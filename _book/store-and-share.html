<p>After we have put together a dataset, an important part of being responsible is storing it appropriately and enabling easy retrieval. While it is certainly possible to be especially concerned about this, and entire careers are based on the storage and retrieval of data, to a certain extent, the baseline is not onerous. If we can get our dataset off our own computer, then we are much of the way there. Further confirming that someone else can retrieve it and use it, puts us much further than most.</p>
<p>That said, the FAIR principles are useful when we come to think more formally about data sharing and management. These are <span class="citation">(<a href="references-1.html#ref-wilkinson2016fair" role="doc-biblioref">M. D. Wilkinson et al. 2016</a>)</span>:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Findable. There is one, unchanging, identifier for the dataset and the dataset has high-quality descriptions and explanations.</li>
<li>Accessible. Standardized approaches can be used to retrieve the data, and these are open and free, possibly with authentication, and that the metadata persists even if the dataset is removed.</li>
<li>Interoperable. The dataset and its metadata use a broadly applicable language, and vocabulary.</li>
<li>Reusable. There is plenty of description of the dataset and the usage conditions are made clear along with provenance.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is important to recognize that just because a dataset is FAIR, it is not necessarily an unbiased representation of the world. FAIR reflects whether a dataset is appropriately available, not whether it is appropriate.</p>
<p>One reason for the rise of data science is that humans are at the heart of it. And often the data that we are interested in directly concern humans. This means there is a tension between sharing the data to facilitate reproducibility and maintaining privacy. Medicine has developed approaches to this over a long time. And out of that we have seen Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in the US, and the related General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe. Our concerns in data science tend to be about personally identifying information (PII). We have a variety of ways to protect especially private information in our datasets, such as emails, including hashing. And sometimes we simulate data and distribute that instead of sharing the actual dataset. More recently, differential privacy is being implemented. But this is usually an inappropriate choice, for anything other than the most massive of datasets and ensures a level of privacy, only at the expense of population minorities.</p>
<p>In this chapter we will consider how we plan and organize our datasets to meet essential requirements. To a large extent we put these in place to make our own life easier when we come back to use our dataset later. We then go through putting our dataset on GitHub, building R packages for data, and finally depositing it in various archives. Then we consider documentation, and in particular focus on datasheets.</p>

<p>The storage and retrieval of information has a long history. This is especially connected with libraries which have existed since antiquity and have established protocols for deciding what information to store and what to discard, as well as its retrieval. One of the defining aspects of libraries is that deliberate curation and organization. The cataloging system ensures that books on similar topics are located close to each other, and there are typically also deliberate plans for ensuring the collection is up-to-date.</p>
<p>Vannevar Bush defines a ‘memex’ in 1945 as a device used to store books, records, and communications, in a way that supplements memory <span class="citation">(<a href="references-1.html#ref-vannevarbush" role="doc-biblioref">Bush 1945</a>)</span>. And the key is the indexing, or linking together of items. We can see this concept echoed in Tim Berners-Lee proposal for hypertext <span class="citation">(<a href="references-1.html#ref-berners1989information" role="doc-biblioref">Berners-Lee 1989</a>)</span>, which led to the World Wide Web. This is the way that resources are identified. They are then transported over the Internet, using HTTP.</p>
<p>At its most fundamental, this is about storing and retrieving data. For instance, we make various files on our computer available to others. The internet is famously brittle, but when we are considering the storage and retrieval of our datasets we want to consider especially, for how long it is important that the data are stored and for whom <span class="citation">(<a href="references-1.html#ref-michener2015ten" role="doc-biblioref">Michener 2015</a>)</span>. For instance, if we want some data to be available for a decade and widely available then it becomes important to store data in open and persistent formats, such as CSVs <span class="citation">(<a href="references-1.html#ref-hart2016ten" role="doc-biblioref">Hart et al. 2016</a>)</span>. But if we are just using some data as part of an intermediate step, we have the raw data, and the scripts to create it, then it might be fine to not worry too much about such considerations.</p>
<p>Storing raw data is important and there are many cases where raw data have revealed or hinted at fraud <span class="citation">(<a href="references-1.html#ref-simonsohn2013just" role="doc-biblioref">Simonsohn 2013</a>)</span>. Shared data also enhances the credibility of our work, by enabling others to verify it, and can lead to the generation of new knowledge as others use it to answer different questions <span class="citation">(<a href="references-1.html#ref-christensen2019transparent" role="doc-biblioref">Christensen, Freese, and Miguel 2019</a>)</span>. Finally, research that shares its data may be more highly cited <span class="citation">(<a href="references-1.html#ref-christensen2019study" role="doc-biblioref">Christensen et al. 2019</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>The easiest place to store our datasets will be GitHub because that is already built into our workflow. For instance, when we push, our dataset becomes available. One great benefit of this is that, if we have set-up our workspace appropriately, then we likely store our raw data, and the tidy data, as well as the scripts that are needed to transform one to the other.</p>
<p>As an example of how we have stored some data, we can access the ‘raw_data.csv’ file from the ‘starter_folder’. To get the file that we pass to <code><a href="https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/read_delim.html">read_csv()</a></code> we navigate to the file in GitHub, and then click ‘Raw’.</p>

<p>One issue with this is that the dataset does not have much documentation. While we can store and retrieve the dataset easily in this way, it lacks much explanation, a formal dictionary, and aspects such as a license that would bring our dataset closer to aligning with the FAIR principles.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">12.3.2</span> R Packages for data<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#r-packages-for-data"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>To this point we have largely used R packages for their code, although we have seen a few that were focused on sharing data, for instance, <span class="citation">Flynn (<a href="references-1.html#ref-troopdata" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span>. We can build an R Package for our dataset and then add it to GitHub. This will make it easy to store and retrieve because we can obtain the dataset by loading the package. This will be the first R package that we build. In Chapter <a href="deploying-models.html#deploying-models">18</a>, will return to R packages and use them to deploy models.</p>
<p>To get started, create a new package (‘File’ -&gt; ‘New project’ -&gt; ‘New Directory’ -&gt; ‘R Package’). Give the package a name, such as ‘favcolordata’ and select ‘Open in new session’. Create a new folder called ‘data’. We will simulate a dataset that we will include.</p>

<p>To this point we have largely been trying to use CSV files for our datasets. To include our data in this R package, we will save our dataset in a particular format, ‘rda’, using <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/save.html">save()</a></code>.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb394"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">

<p>Then create an R file ‘data.R’ in the ‘R’ folder. This R file will only contain documentation using <code>roxygen2</code> comments, which start with <code>#'</code>, and we follow the documentation for <code>troopdata</code> closely.</p>

<p>Finally, we should add a README which provides a summary of all of this for someone coming to the project from the outside.</p>
<p>At this we can go to the ‘Build’ tab and then ‘Install and Restart’. After this happens, the package ‘favcolordata’, is loaded and the data can be accessed using ‘color_data’. If we were to push this to GitHub, then anyone would be able to install the package using <code>devtools</code> <span class="citation">(<a href="references-1.html#ref-citeDevtools" role="doc-biblioref">Wickham, Hester, and Chang 2020</a>)</span> and then use our dataset.</p>

<p>This has addressed many of the issues that we faced earlier. For instance, we have included a README and a data dictionary of sorts in terms of the descriptions that we added. But if we were to try to put this package onto CRAN, then we might face some issues. For instance, the maximum size of a package is 5MB and we would quickly come up against that. We have also largely forced users to use R, and while there are considerable benefits of that, we may like to be more language agnostic <span class="citation">(<a href="references-1.html#ref-tierney2020realistic" role="doc-biblioref">N. J. Tierney and Ram 2020</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>While it is possible that a dataset will be cited if it is available through GitHub or an R package, this becomes more likely if the dataset is deposited somewhere. There are several reasons for this, but one is that it seems a bit more formal. Zenodo and Open Science Framework (OSF) are two that are commonly used. For instance, <span class="citation">C. Carleton (<a href="references-1.html#ref-chris_carleton_2021_4550688" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span> use Zenodo to share the dataset and analysis supporting <span class="citation">W. C. Carleton, Campbell, and Collard (<a href="references-1.html#ref-carleton2021reassessment" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span>. Similarly <span class="citation">Michael et al. (<a href="references-1.html#ref-geuenich_michael_2021_5156049" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span> use Zenodo to share the dataset that underpins <span class="citation">Geuenich et al. (<a href="references-1.html#ref-geuenich2021automated" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span>.
<!-- And Y use OSF to share all files. --></p>
<p>Another option is a dataverse, such as the Harvard Dataverse, which is a common requirement for journal publications. One nice aspect of this is that we can use <code>dataverse</code> <span class="citation">(<a href="references-1.html#ref-dataverse" role="doc-biblioref">Kuriwaki, Beasley, and Leeper 2022</a>)</span> to retrieve the dataset as part of a reproducible workflow.</p>

<p>Datasheets <span class="citation">(<a href="references-1.html#ref-gebru2021datasheets" role="doc-biblioref">Gebru et al. 2021</a>)</span> are an increasingly critical aspect of data science. Datasheets are basically nutrition labels for datasets. The process of creating them enables us to think more carefully about what we will feed our model. More importantly, they enable others to better understand what we fed our model. One important task is going back and putting together datasheets for datasets that are widely used. For instance, researchers went back and wrote a datasheet for one of the most popular datasets in computer science, and they found that around 30 per cent of the data were duplicated <span class="citation">(<a href="references-1.html#ref-bandy2021addressing" role="doc-biblioref">Bandy and Vincent 2021</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Instead of telling us how unhealthy various foods are, a datasheet tells us things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who put the dataset together?</li>
<li>Who paid for the dataset to be created?</li>
<li>How complete is the dataset?</li>
<li>What fields are present, and equally not present, for particular observations?</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes we have done a lot of work to create a dataset. In that case, we may like to publish and share it on its own, for instance, <span class="citation">Biderman, Bicheno, and Gao (<a href="references-1.html#ref-biderman2022datasheet" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span> and <span class="citation">Bandy and Vincent (<a href="references-1.html#ref-bandy2021addressing" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span>. But typically a datasheet might live in an appendix to the paper, or be included in a file adjacent to the dataset.</p>
<p>We will put together a datasheet for the dataset that underpins <span class="citation">R. Alexander and Hodgetts (<a href="references-1.html#ref-citeaustralianpoliticians" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span>. The text of the questions directly comes from <span class="citation">Gebru et al. (<a href="references-1.html#ref-gebru2021datasheets" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span>. When we create datasheets for a dataset, especially a dataset that we did not put together ourselves, it is possible that the answer to some questions will simply be “Unknown”.</p>

<li>
<em>Who created the dataset (for example, which team, research group) and on behalf of which entity (for example, company, institution, organization)?</em>
<ul>
<li>Rohan Alexander, while working at the Australian National University and the University of Toronto</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<em>Who funded the creation of the dataset? If there is an associated grant, please provide the name of the grantor and the grant name and number.</em>

</h2>
<p>Personally identifying information (PII) is that which enables us to link a row in our dataset with an actual person. For instance, email addresses are often PII, as are names and addresses. Interestingly, sometimes the combination of several variables, none of which are PII in and of themselves, can be PII. For instance, age is unlikely PII by itself, but age combined with city, education, and a few other variables could be. One concern is that this re-identification can occur across datasets. Another interesting aspect is that again while some variable may not be PII for almost everyone in the dataset, it can become PII in the extreme. For instance, if we have age, then there are many people of most ages, but there are fewer people in ages over 100 and it likely becomes PII. The same scenario happens with both income and wealth. One response to this is for data to be censored. For instance, we may record age between 0 and 100, and then group everyone over that into ‘101+’.</p>
<p><span class="citation">Zook et al. (<a href="references-1.html#ref-zook2017ten" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span> recommend considering whether data even need to be gathered in the first place. For instance, if a phone number is not absolutely required then it might be better to not gather it in the first place, rather than need to worry about protecting it before data dissemination.</p>
<p>GDPR and HIPAA are two legal structures that govern data in Europe and the US, respectively. Due to the influence of these regions, they have a significant effect outside those regions also. GDPR concerns data generally, while HIPAA is focused on healthcare. GDPR applies to all personal data, which is defined as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘personal data’ means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person;</p>
<p><span class="citation">Council of European Union (<a href="references-1.html#ref-gdpr" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span>, Article 4, ‘Definitions’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>HIPAA refers to the privacy of medical records in the US and codify the idea that the patient should have access to their medical records, and that only the patient should be able to authorize access to their medical records <span class="citation">(<a href="references-1.html#ref-annas2003hipaa" role="doc-biblioref">Annas 2003</a>)</span>. While it only applies to covered entities, it sets a standard that informs practice, yet is piecemeal given the variety of applications. For instance, a person’s social media posts about their health is generally not subject to it, nor is knowledge about a person’s location and how active they are, even though based on that information we may be able to get some idea of their health <span class="citation">(<a href="references-1.html#ref-Cohen2018" role="doc-biblioref">Cohen and Mello 2018</a>)</span>. Such data are hugely valuable <span class="citation">(<a href="references-1.html#ref-ibmdataset" role="doc-biblioref">Ross 2022</a>)</span>.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">12.5.1</span> Hashing and salting<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#hashing-and-salting"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>A hash is a one-way transformation of data, such that the same input always provides the same output, but given the output, it is not reasonably possible to obtain the input. For instance, a function that doubled its input always gives the same output, for the same input, but is also easy to reverse.</p>
<p><span class="citation">Knuth (<a href="references-1.html#ref-knuth" role="doc-biblioref">1998, 514</a>)</span> relates an interesting etymology for ‘hash’ by first defining ‘to hash’ as relating to chop up or make a mess, and then explaining that hashing relates to scrambling the input and using this partial information to define the output. A collision is when different inputs map to the same output, and one feature of a good hashing algorithm is that collisions are reduced. One simple approach is to rely on the modulo operator. For instance, if we were interested in 10 different groupings for the integers 1 through to 10. A better approach would be for the number of groupings to be a prime number, such as 11 or 853.</p>

<p>We could share either of these and be comfortable that, in general, it would be difficult for someone to use only that information to recover the names of our respondents. That is not to say that it is impossible. If we made a mistake, such as accidentally committing the original dataset to GitHub then they could be recovered. And of course, it is likely that various governments have the ability to reverse the cryptographic hashes used here.</p>
<p>One issue that remains is that anyone can take advantage of the key feature of hashing being that the same input always gets the same output, to test various options for inputs. For instance, they could, themselves try to has ‘Rohan’, and then noticing that the hash is the same as the one that we published in our dataset, know that data relates to that particular individual. We could try to keep our hashing approach secret, but that is difficult as there are only a few that was widely used. One approach is to add a salt that we keep secret. This slightly changes the input. For instance, we could add the salt ’_is_a_person’ to all our names and then hash that, although a large random number might be a better option. Provided the salt is not shared, then it would be difficult for most folks to reverse our approach in that way.</p>

<p>One common approach to deal with the issue of being unable to share the actual data that underpins an analysis, is to use data simulation. We have used data simulation throughout this book toward the start of the workflow to help us to think more deeply about our dataset before we turn to it. We can use data simulation again at the end, to ensure that others cannot think about our actual dataset. The workflow advocated in this book makes this relatively straight-forward.</p>
<p>The approach is to understand the critical features of the dataset and the appropriate distribution. For instance, if our data were the ages of some population, then we may want to use the Poisson distribution and experiment with different parameters for lambda. Having simulated a dataset, we conduct our analysis using this simulated dataset and ensure that the results are broadly similar to when we use the real data. We can then release the simulated dataset along with our code.</p>

<p>Differential privacy implements a mathematical definition of privacy, that means that even if datasets are combined, a certain level of privacy will be maintained. A dataset is differentially private to different levels, based on how much it changes when one person’s results are removed.</p>
<p>A variant of differential privacy has recently been implemented by the US census. This has been shown to not universally protect respondent privacy, and yet it is expected to have a significant effect on redistricting <span class="citation">(<a href="references-1.html#ref-kenny2021impact" role="doc-biblioref">Kenny et al. 2021</a>)</span>. <span class="citation">Suriyakumar et al.
