## Introduction

As we think about our world and telling stories about it, one of the most difficult aspects is to reduce the beautiful complexity of it into a dataset that we can use. We need to know what we are giving up when we do this. Often, we are interested in understanding the implications of some dataset, making forecasts based on it, or using that dataset to make claims about the broader world. Regardless of how we turn our world into data, we will only ever have a sample of the data that we need. Statistics provides formal approaches that we use to keep these issues front of mind.

In this chapter we first 
introduce statistical notions around sampling to provide a framework that we use to guide our data gathering. We then
go through a variety of approaches for gathering data, including the use of APIs and semi-structured data, such as JSON and XML, web scraping, converting PDFs,
and using optical character recognition, especially to obtain text data.


## Sampling essentials

<!-- > By a small sample we may judge the whole piece. -->
<!-- >  -->
<!-- >  -->

Statistics is at the heart of telling stories with data. Statisticians have spent considerable time and effort thinking about the properties that various samples of data will have and how they enable us to speak to implications for the broader population.

Let us say that we have some data. For instance, a particular toddler goes to sleep at 6:00pm every night. We might be interested to know whether that bedtime is common among all toddlers, or if we have an unusual toddler. We only have one toddler so our ability to use his bedtime to speak about all toddlers is limited.

One approach would be to talk to friends who also have toddlers. And then talk to friends of friends. How many friends, and friends of friends, do we have to ask because we can begin to feel comfortable speaking about some underlying truth of toddler bedtime?

@wuandthompson [p. 3] describe statistics as 'the science of how to collect and analyze data and draw statements and conclusions about unknown populations.' Here 'population' refers to some infinite group that we can never know exactly, but that we can use the probability distributions of random variables to describe the characteristics of. Another way to say this is that statistics involves getting some data and trying to say something sensible based on it.

Some of the critical terminology includes:

- 'Target population': The collection of all items about which we would like to speak.
- 'Sampling frame': A list of all the items from the target population that we could get data about.
- 'Sample': The items from the sampling frame that we get data about.

A target population is a finite set of labelled items, of size $N$. For instance, we could hypothetically add a label to all the books in the world: 'Book 1', 'Book 2', 'Book 3', ..., 'Book $N$'. There is a difference between use of the term population here, and that of everyday usage. For instance, one sometimes hears those who work with census data say that they do not need to worry about sampling because they have the whole population of the country. This is a conflation of the terms, as what they have is the sample gathered by the census of the population of a country.

It can be difficult to define a target population. For instance, say we have been asked to find out about the consumption habits of hipsters. How can we define that target population? If someone regularly eats avocado toast, but has never drunk bullet coffee, then are they in the population? Some aspects that we might be interested in are formally defined to an extent that is not always commonly realized. For instance, whether an area is classified as rural is often formally defined by a country's statistical agency. But other aspects are less clear. For instance, how do we classify someone as a 'smoker'? If a 15-year-old has had 100 cigarettes over their lifetime, then we need to treat them differently than if they have had none. But if a 90-year-old has had 100 cigarettes over their lifetime, then are they likely to different to a 90-year-old who has had none? At what age, and number of cigarettes do these answers change?

Consider if we want to speak to the titles of all the books ever written. Our target population is all books ever written. But it is almost impossible for us to imagine that we could get information about the title of a book that was written in the nineteenth century, but that the author locked in their desk and never told anyone about. One sampling frame could be all books in the Library of Congress Online Catalog, another could be the 25 million that were digitized by Google [@somers2017torching]. And then finally, our sample may be the tens of thousands that are available through Project Gutenberg, and that we can access using `gutenbergr` [@gutenbergr].

To consider another example, consider wanting to speak of the attitudes of all Brazilians who live in Germany. The target population is all Brazilians who live in Germany. One possible source of information would be Facebook and so in that case, the sampling frame might be all Brazilians who live in Germany who have Facebook. And then our sample be might all Brazilians who live in Germany who have Facebook who we can gather data about. The target population and the sampling frame will be different because not all Brazilians who live in Germany will have Facebook. And the sampling frame will be different to the sample because we will likely not be able to gather data about all Brazilians who live in Germany and have Facebook.


### Sampling in Dublin and Reading

To be clearer, we will consider two examples: a 1798 count of the number of inhabitants of Dublin, Ireland [@whatasurvey], and a 1912 count of working-class households in Reading, England [@bowley1913working].

In 1798 the Reverend James Whitelaw conducted a survey of Dublin, Ireland, to count its population. @whatasurvey describes how population estimates had a wide variation, for instance the estimated size of London at the time ranged from 128,570 to 300,000. Reverend Whitelaw expected that the Lord Mayor of Dublin could compel the person in charge of each house to affix a list of the inhabitants of that house to the door, and then Reverend Whitelaw could simply use this. 

Instead, he found that the lists were 'frequently illegible, and generally short of the actual number by a third, or even one-half'. And so instead he recruited assistants, and they went door-to-door making their own counts. The resulting estimates are particularly informative (Figure \@ref(fig:whitelawsresults)). And the total population of Dublin in 1798 was estimated at 182,370.

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="/Users/rohanalexander/Documents/book/figures/whitelaw.png" alt="Extract of the results that Reverend Whitelaw found in 1798" width="85%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:whitelawsresults)Extract of the results that Reverend Whitelaw found in 1798</p>
</div>

One aspect worth noticing is that Reverend Whitelaw includes information about class. It is difficult to know how that was determined, but it played a large role in the data collection. Reverend Whitelaw describes how the houses of 'the middle and upper classes always contained some individual who was competent to the task [of making a list]'. But that 'among the lower class, which forms the great mass of the population of this city, the case was very different'. It is difficult to know how Reverend Whitelaw could have known that the upper and middle classes were not representing their number, while the lower class was. It is also difficult to imagine Reverend Whitelaw going into the houses of the upper class and counting their number, as he and his assistants did for the lower classes. As always, the issue of defining the target population is a difficult one, and it seems that there may have been slightly different approaches to each class. 

A little over one hundred years later, @bowley1913working was interested in counting the number of working-class households in Reading, England. Bowley selects the sample using the following procedure [@bowley1913working, p. 672]:

> One building in ten was marked throughout the local directory in alphabetical order of streets, making about 1,950 in all. Of those about 300 were marked as shops, factories, institutions and non-residential buildings, and about 300 were found to be indexed among Principal Residents, and were so marked. The remaining 1,350 were working-class houses, and a number of volunteers set out to visit every one of these... [I]t was decided to take only one house in 20, rejecting the incomplete information as to the intermediate tenths. The visitors were instructed never to substitute another house for that marked, however difficult it proved to get information, or whatever the type of house.

@bowley1913working continues that they ended up with information about 622 working-class households. And, having judged, based on the census that there were about 18,000 households in Reading, @bowley1913working applies '[t]he multiplier twenty-one... to all the sample data to give estimates for the whole of Reading.' @bowley1913working explains that the reasonableness of the estimates depends 'not on its proportion to the whole, but on its own magnitude, if the conditions of random sampling are secured, as it is believed they have been in this inquiry'. Bowley is, for instance, able to furnish information about the rent paid per week (Figure \@ref(fig:bowleyrents)).

<p class="caption">(\#fig:bowleyrents)Extract of the results that Bowley found about rent paid by the working-class in Reading</p>
</div>



### Probabilistic sampling

Having identified a target population and a sampling frame, we need to distinguish between probability and non-probability sampling, which @neyman1934two describes as 'random sampling' and 'purposive selection':

- 'Probability sampling': Every unit in the sampling frame has some, known, chance of being sampled and the specific sample is obtained randomly based on these chances. Note that these chances do not necessarily need to be same for each unit.
- 'Non-probability sampling': Units from the sampling frame are sampled based on convenience, quotas, judgement, or other non-random processes.

Often the difference between probability and non-probability sampling is one of degree. For instance, we cannot often forcibly obtain data and so there is almost always an aspect of volunteering. Even when there are penalties for not providing data, such as the case for completing a census form in many countries, it is difficult for even a government to force people to fill it out completely or truthfully. One reason that the Randomized Control Trial revolution, discussed in Chapter \@ref(hunt-data), was needed was due to a lack of probability sampling. The most important aspect to be clear about with probability sampling is the role of uncertainty. This allows us to make claims about the population, based on our sample, with known amounts of error. The trade-off is that probability sampling is often expensive and difficult.


To add some more specificity to our discussion, following @lohr [p. 27] it may help to consider the numbers 1 to 100 and let us define that as our target population. With simple random sampling, every unit has the same chance of being included. In this case it is 20 per cent. We would expect to have around 20 units in our sample, or around 1 in 5 compared with our target population.


```r
library(tidyverse)

set.seed(853)

illustrative_sampling <-
  tibble(unit = 1:100,
         simple_random_sampling = 
           sample(
             x = c("Included", "Not included"),
             size = 100,
             replace = TRUE,
             prob = c(0.2, 0.8)
             ))

illustrative_sampling
#> # A tibble: 100 Ã 2
#>     unit simple_random_sampling
#>    <int> <chr>                 
#>  1     1 Not included          
#>  2     2 Not included          
#>  3     3 Not included          
#>  4     4 Not included          
#>  5     5 Not included          
#>  6     6 Not included          
#>  7     7 Not included          
#>  8     8 Not included          
#>  9     9 Not included          
#> 10    10 Not included          
#> # â¦ with 90 more rows
```

With systematic sampling, as was used by @bowley1913working, we proceed by selecting some value, say 5. We randomly pick a starting point in units 1 to 5, say 3. And we then include every fifth unit. That starting point is usually randomly selecting.


```r
set.seed(853)

starting_point <- sample(x = c(1:5), 
                         size = 1)

illustrative_sampling <-
  illustrative_sampling |>
  mutate(systematic_sampling = 
           if_else(row_number() %in% seq.int(from = starting_point, 
                                             to = 100, 
                                             by = 5), 
                   "Included", 
                   "Not included")
         )

illustrative_sampling
#> # A tibble: 100 Ã 3
#>     unit simple_random_sampling systematic_sampling
#>    <int> <chr>                  <chr>              
#>  1     1 Not included           Included           
#>  2     2 Not included           Not included       
#>  3     3 Not included           Not included       
#>  4     4 Not included           Not included       
#>  5     5 Not included           Not included       
#>  6     6 Not included           Included           
#>  7     7 Not included           Not included       
#>  8     8 Not included           Not included       
#>  9     9 Not included           Not included       
#> 10    10 Not included           Not included       
#> # â¦ with 90 more rows
```

When we consider our population, it will typically have some grouping. This may be as straight-forward as a country having states, provinces, counties, or statistical districts; a university having faculties and departments; and humans having age-groups. A stratified structure is one in which we can divide the population into mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive sub-populations, or strata.

We use stratification to help with the efficiency of sampling or with the balance of the survey. For instance, the population of the US is around 335 million, with 40 million being in California, while Wyoming as around half a million. So even a survey of 10,000 responses would only expect to have 15 responses from Wyoming, which could make inference about Wyoming difficult. We could use stratification to ensure there are 200 responses from each of the 50 US states. We would use random sampling within each state to select the person about whom data will be gathered.

In our case, we will stratify our illustration, we will consider that our strata are the 10s, that is, 1 to 10 is one stratum, 11 to 20 is another, and so on. We will use simple random sampling within these strata to select two units.


```r
set.seed(853)

selected_within_strata <-
  illustrative_sampling |>
  mutate(strata = (row_number() - 1) %/% 10) |>
  group_by(strata) |>
  slice_sample(n = 2) |>
  pull(unit)

illustrative_sampling <-
  illustrative_sampling |>
  mutate(
    stratified_sampling = if_else(
      row_number() %in% selected_within_strata,
      "Included",
      "Not included"
    )
  )

illustrative_sampling
#> # A tibble: 100 Ã 4
#>     unit simple_random_saâ¦ systematic_sampâ¦ stratified_sampâ¦
#>    <int> <chr>             <chr>            <chr>           
#>  1     1 Not included      Included         Included        
#>  2     2 Not included      Not included     Not included    
#>  3     3 Not included      Not included     Not included    
#>  4     4 Not included      Not included     Not included    
#>  5     5 Not included      Not included     Not included    
#>  6     6 Not included      Included         Not included    
#>  7     7 Not included      Not included     Not included    
#>  8     8 Not included      Not included     Not included    
#>  9     9 Not included      Not included     Included        
#> 10    10 Not included      Not included     Not included    
#> # â¦ with 90 more rows
```

And finally, we can also take advantage of some clusters that may exist in our dataset. Like strata, clusters are collectively exhaustive and mutually exclusive. Our examples from earlier, of states, departments, and age-groups remain valid as clusters. However, it is our intentions toward these groups that is different. Specific, with cluster sampling, we do not intend to collect data from every cluster, whereas with stratified sampling we do. With stratified sampling we look at every stratum and conduct simple random sampling within each strata to select the sample. With cluster sampling we conduct simple random sampling to select clusters of interest. We can then either sample every unit in those selected clusters or use simple random sampling, within the selected clusters, to select units. That all said, this difference can become less clear in practice, especially *ex post*.

In our case, we will cluster our illustration again based on the 10s. We will use simple random sampling to select two clusters for which we will use the entire cluster.


```r
set.seed(853)

selected_clusters <- 
  sample(x = c(0:9),
         size = 2)

illustrative_sampling <-
  illustrative_sampling |>
  mutate(cluster = (row_number() - 1) %/% 10, 
         cluster_sampling = if_else(
           cluster %in% selected_clusters,
           "Included",
           "Not included"
           )
         ) %>% 
  select(-cluster)

illustrative_sampling
#> # A tibble: 100 Ã 5
#>     unit simple_random_saâ¦ systematic_sampâ¦ stratified_sampâ¦
#>    <int> <chr>             <chr>            <chr>           
#>  1     1 Not included      Included         Included        
#>  2     2 Not included      Not included     Not included    
#>  3     3 Not included      Not included     Not included    
#>  4     4 Not included      Not included     Not included    
#>  5     5 Not included      Not included     Not included    
#>  6     6 Not included      Included         Not included    
#>  7     7 Not included      Not included     Not included    
#>  8     8 Not included      Not included     Not included    
#>  9     9 Not included      Not included     Included        
#> 10    10 Not included      Not included     Not included    
#> # â¦ with 90 more rows, and 1 more variable:
#> #   cluster_sampling <chr>
```

At this point we can illustrate the differences between our approaches (Figure \@ref(fig:samplingexamples)).

Having established our sample, we typically want to use it to make claims about the population. @neyman1934two [p. 561] goes further and says that '[o]bviously the problem of the representative method is *par excellence* the problem of statistical estimation. We are interested in characteristics of a certain population, such $\pi$, which it is either impossible or at least very difficult to study in detail, and we try to estimate these characteristics basing our judgment on the sample.'

In particular, we would typically be interested to estimate a population mean and variance.


<!-- ADD estimators of population mean and variances, etc -->


Scaling up can be used when we are interested in using a count from our sample to imply some total count for the population. We saw this in @bowley1913working where the ratio of the number of households in the sample, compared with the number of households known from the census, is 21, and this information is used to scale up the sample. 

To consider an example, perhaps we were interested in the sum of the numbers from 1 to 100. We know that our samples are of size 20, and so need to be scaled up five times (Table \@ref(tab:scaleup)).


```r
illustrative_sampling_long |>
  filter(in_sample == "Included") |>
  group_by(sampling_method) |>
  summarize(sum_from_sample = sum(unit)) |>
  mutate(scaled_by_five = sum_from_sample * 5) |>
  knitr::kable(
    caption = "Sum of the numbers in each sample, and implied sum of population",
    col.names = c("Sampling method", "Sum of sample", "Implied population sum"),
    format.args = list(big.mark = ",")
  )
```



Table: (\#tab:scaleup)Sum of the numbers in each sample, and implied sum of population

|Sampling method        | Sum of sample| Implied population sum|
|:----------------------|-------------:|----------------------:|
|simple_random_sampling |           840|                  4,200|
|systematic_sampling    |           970|                  4,850|
|stratified_sampling    |           979|                  4,895|
|cluster_sampling       |           910|                  4,550|

The actual sum of the population is 5,050. We can obtain this using a trick, attributed to Euler, who noticed that the sum of 1 to any number can be quickly obtained by finding the middle number and then multiplying that by one plus the number. So, in this case, it `50*101`. Alternatively we can use R: `sum(1:100)`.

Our estimate of the population sum, based on the scaling, are especially revealing. The closest is stratified sample, closely followed by systematic sampling. Cluster sampling is a little over 10 per cent off, while simple random sampling is a little further away. To get close, it is important that our sampling method gets as many of the higher values as possible. And so stratified and systematic sampling, both of which ensured that we had unit from the larger numbers did particularly well. The performance of cluster and simple random sampling would depend on the particular clusters, and units, selected. In this case, stratified and systematic sampling ensured that our estimate of the sum of the population, would not be too far away from the actual population sum.


This approach has a long history. For instance, Adolphe Quetelet, the nineteenth century astronomer, mathematician, statistician, and sociologist proposed one. @stigler [p. 163] describes how by 1826 Quetelet had become involved in the statistical bureau, and they were planning for a census. Quetelet argued that births and deaths were well known, but migration was not. He proposed an approach based on counts in specific geographies, which could then be scaled up to the whole country. The criticism of the plan focused on the difficulty of selecting appropriate geographies, which we saw also in our example of cluster sampling. The criticism was reasonable, and even today, some two hundred years later, something that we should keep front of mind, [@stigler]:

> He [Quetelet] was acutely aware of the infinite number of factors that could affect the quantities he wished to measure, and he lacked the information that could tell him which were indeed important. He... was reluctant to group together as homogenous, data that he had reason to believe was not... To be aware of a myriad of potentially important factors, without knowing which are truly important and how their effect may be felt, is often to fear the worst'.... He [Quetelet] could not bring himself to treat large regions as homogeneous, [and so] he could not think of a single rate as applying to a large area

We are able to do this scaling up when we know the population total, but if we do not know that, or we have concerns around the precision of that approach then we may use a ratio estimator.

Ratio estimators also have a long history. For instance, in 1802 they were used by Pierre-Simon Laplace to estimate the total population of France, based on the ratio of the number of registered births, which was known throughout the country, to the number of inhabitants, which was only know for certain communes. He calculated this ratio for the three communes, and then scaled it, based on knowing the number of births across the whole country to produce an estimate of the population of France [@lohr].


<!-- For instance, Adolphe Quetelet, the nineteenth century astronomer, mathematician, statistician and sociologist describes them [@quetelet2013treatise, p. 11]: -->

<!-- > Some calculations which I shall advance will make this easily understood. Let $f$ be the fecundity of a country, $n$ the annual number of births, $m$ that of marriages, $c$ the remainder of the population, and $f'$, $n'$, $m'$, and $c'$, respectively, the same numbers for another country; we shall have for the fecundity of marriages the proportion -->
<!-- $$f:f'::\frac{n}{m}:\frac{n'}{m'}$$ -->
<!-- Now if the populations be homogenous, as in the case which we are supposing, we shall also have -->
<!-- $$\frac{m}{c+m} = \frac{m'}{c'+m'}$$ -->
<!-- Now, if we multiply both terms of the latter ratio of the proportion by this equality, we shall have -->
<!-- $$f:f'::\frac{n}{c+m}:\frac{n'}{c'+m'}$$ -->
<!-- ---a result agreeable to what is advanced in the text, since the terms of the latter ratio represent the fecundity of the population. -->

In particular, a ratio estimator of some population parameter is the ratio of two means. For instance, we may have some information on the number of hours that a toddler sleeps overnight, $x$, and the number of hours their parents sleep overnight $y$ over a 30 day period.


```r
set.seed(853)

sleep <- 
  tibble(
    toddler_sleep = sample(x = c(2:14), size = 30, replace = TRUE),
    difference = sample(x = c(0:3), size = 30, replace = TRUE),
    parent_sleep = toddler_sleep - difference
  )

sleep
#> # A tibble: 30 Ã 3
#>    toddler_sleep difference parent_sleep
#>            <int>      <int>        <int>
#>  1            10          1            9
#>  2            11          0           11
#>  3            14          2           12
#>  4             2          2            0
#>  5             6          1            5
#>  6            14          2           12
#>  7             3          0            3
#>  8             5          2            3
#>  9             4          3            1
#> 10             4          1            3
#> # â¦ with 20 more rows
```

And the average of each is:


```r
sleep %>% 
  summarize(toddler_sleep_average = mean(toddler_sleep),
            parent_sleep_average = mean(parent_sleep))
#> # A tibble: 1 Ã 2
#>   toddler_sleep_average parent_sleep_average
#>                   <dbl>                <dbl>
#> 1                  6.17                  4.9
```

Then the ratio estimate of the proportion of sleep that a parent gets compared with their toddler is:

$$\hat{B} = \frac{\bar{y}}{\bar{x}} = \frac{4.9}{6.16} \approx 0.8$$







<!-- # Turn to measurement errors here??? -->

<!-- '... Astronomers had overcome a similar case of intellectual cold feet in the previous century by comparing observations with fact, by comparing prediction with realization. Success had bolstered confidence in the combination of observations. Social scientists were to require massive empirical data gathered under a wide variety of circumstances before they gained the astronomers' confidence that the quantities they measured were of sufficient stability that the uncertainty of the estimates was itself susceptible to measurement. -->




<!-- We now turn to the first of our claims, which is that if we have a perfect frame and no non-response, then our sample results will match that of the population. We would be very worried if that were not the case, but it is nice to have it stated. We establish some type of population mean for the study variable, $\mu_y$, and population means for the auxiliary variables $\mu_x$, which could be things like age, gender, etc. Remembering that when we do this in the real world, we may have many study variables, and indeed, some overlap. If a variable is an indicator then in this set-up all we have to do is to work out the proportion in order to estimate it, which is $P$. And finally, we get a rule of thumb for large samples whereby the variance in this binary and perfect setting becomes $\sigma_y^2 = P/(1-P)$. -->

While acknowledging that it is a spectrum, much of statistics was developed based on probability sampling. But a considerable amount of modern sampling is done using non-probability sampling. A common approach is to use Facebook and other advertisements to recruit a panel of respondents in exchange for compensation. This panel is then the group that is sent various surveys as necessary. But think for a moment about the implications of this. For instance, what type of people are likely to respond to such an advertisement? Is the richest person in the world likely to respond? Are especially young or especially old people likely to respond? In some cases, it is possible to do a census. Nation-states typically do one every five to ten years. But there is a reason that it is only nation states that do them---they are expensive, time-consuming, and surprisingly, they are sometimes not as accurate as we may hope because of how general they need to be.


### Non-probability samples

Non-probability samples have an important role to play because they are typically cheaper and quicker to obtain than probability samples. Further, as we have discussed, the difference between probability and non-probability samples is sometimes one of degree, rather than dichotomy. In any case, non-probability samples are legitimate and appropriate for some tasks provided one is clear about the trade-offs and ensure transparency [@nonprobabilitysmaples].

Convenience sampling involves gathering data from a sample that is easy to access. For instance, one often asks one's friends and family to fill out a survey as a way of testing it before more wide-scale distribution. If instead we were to analyze such a sample, then we would likely be using convenience sampling. 

The main issue with convenience sampling is that it is unlikely to be able to speak to much of a broader population than those who filled out the survey. There are also tricky ethical considerations, and typically a lack of anonymity which may further bias the results. On the other hand, it can be useful to cheaply get a quick sense of a situation while rolling out sampling approaches likely to be more broadly useful.

Quota sampling occurs when we have strata, but we do not use random sampling within those strata to select the unit. For instance, if we again stratified the US based on state, but then instead of ensuring that everyone in Wyoming had the chance to be chosen for that stratum, just picked people at Jackson Hole. Again, there are some advantages to this approach, especially in terms of speed and cost, but the resulting sample is likely biased in various ways. 

As the saying goes, birds of a feather flock together. And we can take advantage of that in our sampling. Although @handcock2011comment describe various uses before this, and it is notoriously difficult to define attribution in multidisciplinary work, snowball sampling is nicely defined by @goodman1961snowball. Following @goodman1961snowball, to conduct snowball sampling, we first draw a random sample from the sampling frame. Each of these is asked to name $k$ others also in the sample population, but not in that initial draw, and these form the 'first stage'. Each individual in the first stage is then similarly asked to name $k$ others who are also in the sample population, but again not in the random draw or the first stage, and these form the 'second stage'. We need to have specified the number of stages, $s$, and also $k$ ahead of time.

Respondent-driven sampling was developed by @heckathorn1997respondent to focus on hidden populations, which are those for which: 1) there is no sampling frame and 2) being known to be in the sampling population could have a negative effect. For instance, we could imagine various countries in which it would be difficult to sample from the gay population or those who have had abortions because it is illegal. Respondent-driven sampling differs from snowball sampling in two ways: 1) In addition to compensation for their own response, as is the case with snowball sampling, respondent-driven sampling typically also involves compensation for recruiting others. 2) Respondents are not asked to provide information about others to the investigator, but instead recruit them into the study. Selection into the sample occurs not from sampling frame, but instead from the networks of those already in the sample [@salganik2004sampling].


Having established the foundations of sampling, which should remain front of mind, we turn to describe some approaches to gathering data. These will largely represent convenience samples.

## APIs

In everyday language, and for our purposes, an Application Programming Interface (API) is a situation in which someone has set up specific files on their computer such that we can follow their instructions to get them. For instance, when we use a gif on Slack, Slack asks Giphy's server for the appropriate gif, Giphy's server gives that gif to Slack and then Slack inserts it into your chat. The way in which Slack and Giphy interact is determined by Giphy's API. More strictly, an API is just an application that runs on a server that we access using the HTTP protocol. 

We focus on using APIs for gathering data. And so, with that focus, an API is a website that is set-up for another computer to be able to access, rather than a person. For instance, we could go to Google Maps: https://www.google.com/maps. And we could then scroll and click and drag to center the map on Canberra, Australia. Or we could paste this into the browser: https://www.google.com/maps/@-35.2812958,149.1248113,16z. We just used the Google Maps API, and the result should be a map similar to Figure \@ref(fig:focuson2020).

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="/Users/rohanalexander/Documents/book/figures/googlemaps.png" alt="Example of Google Maps, as at 29 January 2022" width="90%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:focuson2020)Example of Google Maps, as at 29 January 2022</p>
</div>

The advantage of using an API is that the data provider specifies exactly the data that they are willing to provide, and the terms under which they will provide it. These terms may include aspects such as rate limits (i.e. how often we can ask for data), and what we can do with the data, for instance, we might not be allowed to use it for commercial purposes, or to republish it. Additionally, because the API is being provided specifically for us to use it, it is less likely to be subject to unexpected changes or legal issues. Because of this it is ethically and legally clear that when an API is available we should try to use it rather than web scraping.

We will now go through a few case studies of using APIs. In the first we deal directly with an API using `httr` [@citehttr]. In the second we access data from Twitter using `rtweet` [@rtweet]. And in the third we access data from Spotify using `spotifyr` [@spotifyr]. Developing comfort with gathering data through APIs enables access to exciting datasets. For instance, @facebookapitrump use the Facebook Political Ad API to gather all 218,100 of the Trump 2020 campaign ads to better understand the campaign.



### Case study: Gathering data from arXiv, NASA, and Dataverse

We use `GET()` from `httr` [@citehttr] to obtain data from an API directly. This will try to get some specific data and the main argument is 'url'. In a way, this is very similar to the earlier Google Maps example. In that example, the specific information that we were interested in was a map. 

In this case study we will use an API provided by arXiv: https://arxiv.org. arXiv is an online repository for academic papers before they go through peer-review, and these are typically referred to as 'pre-prints'. After installing and loading `httr`, we use `GET()` to ask arXiv to obtain some information about the pre-print of @Alexander2020. 


```r
library(httr)
library(tidyverse)
library(xml2)

arxiv <-
  GET("http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?id_list=2111.09299")

status_code(arxiv)
#> [1] 200
```

We can use `status_code()` to check whether we received an error from the server. And assuming we received something back from the server, we can use `content()` to display the information. In this case we have received XML formatted data, which we can read using `read_xml()` from `xml2` [@xml2]. XML is a semi-formatted structure, and it can be useful to start by having a look at it using `html_structure()`.


```r
content(arxiv) |>
  read_xml() |>
  html_structure()
#> <feed [xmlns]>
#>   <link [href, rel, type]>
#>   <title [type]>
#>     {text}
#>   <id>
#>     {text}
#>   <updated>
#>     {text}
#>   <totalResults [xmlns:opensearch]>
#>     {text}
#>   <startIndex [xmlns:opensearch]>
#>     {text}
#>   <itemsPerPage [xmlns:opensearch]>
#>     {text}
#>   <entry>
#>     <id>
#>       {text}
#>     <updated>
#>       {text}
#>     <published>
#>       {text}
#>     <title>
#>       {text}
#>     <summary>
#>       {text}
#>     <author>
#>       <name>
#>         {text}
#>     <author>
#>       <name>
#>         {text}
#>     <comment [xmlns:arxiv]>
#>       {text}
#>     <link [href, rel, type]>
#>     <link [title, href, rel, type]>
#>     <primary_category [term, scheme, xmlns:arxiv]>
#>     <category [term, scheme]>
```

Or we might be interested to create a dataset based on extracting various aspects of this XML tree. For instance, we might be interested to look at the 'entry', which is the eighth item, and in particular to obtain the title and the URL, which are the fourth and ninth items, respectively, within entry. 


```r
data_from_arxiv <-
  tibble(
    title = content(arxiv) |>
      read_xml() |>
      xml_child(search = 8) |>
      xml_child(search = 4) |>
      xml_text(),
    link = content(arxiv) |>
      read_xml() |>
      xml_child(search = 8) |>
      xml_child(search = 9) |>
      xml_attr("href")
  )
data_from_arxiv
#> # A tibble: 1 Ã 2
#>   title                                                link 
#>   <chr>                                                <chr>
#> 1 "The Increased Effect of Elections and Changing Priâ¦ httpâ¦
```

Each day NASA provides the Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) through its APOD API. We can again use `GET()` to obtain the URL for the photo on particular dates and then display it. 


```r
NASA_APOD_20211226 <-
  GET("https://api.nasa.gov/planetary/apod?api_key=DEMO_KEY&date=2021-12-26")

NASA_APOD_20190719 <-
  GET("https://api.nasa.gov/planetary/apod?api_key=DEMO_KEY&date=2019-07-19")
```

Examining the returned data using `content()`, we can see that we are provided with various fields, such as date, title, explanation, and a URL. And we can provide that URL to `include_graphics()` from `knitr` to display it (Figure \@ref(fig:nasaone)).

Finally, another common API response in semi-structured form is JSON. We can parse JSON with `jsonlite` [@jsonlite]. A Dataverse is a web application that makes it easier to share dataset. We can use an API go query a demonstration dataverse. For instance we might be interested in datasets related to politics.


```r
library(jsonlite)

politics_datasets <- fromJSON("https://demo.dataverse.org/api/search?q=politics")
```

We can also look at the dataset using `View(politics_datasets)`, which allows us to expand the tree based on what we are interested in and even get the code that we need to focus on different aspects by hovering on the item and then clicking the icon with the green arrow (Figure \@ref(fig:jsonfirst)).

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="/Users/rohanalexander/Documents/book/figures/jsonlite.png" alt="Example of hovering over an JSON element, 'items', where the icon with a green arrow can be clicked on to get the code that would focus on that element" width="90%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:jsonfirst)Example of hovering over an JSON element, 'items', where the icon with a green arrow can be clicked on to get the code that would focus on that element</p>

### Case study: Gathering data from Twitter

Twitter is a rich source of text and other data. The Twitter API is the way in which Twitter asks that we gather these data. And `rtweet` [@rtweet] is built around this API and allows us to interact with it in ways that are similar to using any other R package. Initially, we can use the Twitter API with just a regular Twitter account. 

Begin by installing and loading `rtweet` and `tidyverse`. We then need to authorize `rtweet` and we start that process by calling a function from the package, for instance `get_favorites()` which will return a tibble of a user's favorites. This will open a browser, and we then log into a regular Twitter account (Figure \@ref(fig:rtweetlogin)).


```r
library(rtweet)
library(tidyverse)
```


```r
get_favorites(user = "RohanAlexander")
```

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="/Users/rohanalexander/Documents/book/figures/rtweet.png" alt="rtweet authorisation page" width="90%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:rtweetlogin)rtweet authorisation page</p>
</div>

Once the application is authorized, then we can use `get_favorites()` to actually get the favorites of a user and save them.


```r
rohans_favorites <- get_favorites("RohanAlexander")

saveRDS(rohans_favorites, "rohans_favorites.rds")
```





We could then look at some recent favorites, keeping in mind that they may be different depending on when they are being accessed.


```r
rohans_favorites |> 
  arrange(desc(created_at)) |> 
  slice(1:10) |> 
  select(screen_name, text)
#> # A tibble: 10 Ã 2
#>    screen_name text                                         
#>    <chr>       <chr>

#> 10 flynnpolsci "Iâm not great at coming up with assignmentsâ¦
```

We can use `search_tweets()` to search for tweets about a particular topic. For instance, we could look at tweets using a hashtag commonly associated with R: '#rstats'. 


```r
rstats_tweets <- search_tweets(
  q = "#rstats",
  include_rts = FALSE
)

saveRDS(rstats_tweets, "rstats_tweets.rds")
```






```r
rstats_tweets |> 
  select(screen_name, text) |> 
  head()
#> # A tibble: 6 Ã 2
#>   screen_name     text                                      
#>   <chr>           <chr>

#> 4 PDH_SciTechNews "#Coding Arm Puts Security Architecture tâ¦
#> 5 PDH_SciTechNews "#Coding Network Engineer: Skills, Roles â¦
#> 6 PDH_SciTechNews "#Coding CockroachDB Strengthens Change Dâ¦
```

Other useful functions that can be used include `get_friends()` to get all the accounts that a user follows, and `get_timelines()` to get a user's recent tweets. Registering as a developer enables access to more API functionality. 

When using APIs, even when they are wrapped in an R package, in this case `rtweet`, it is important to read the terms under which access is provided. The Twitter API docs are surprisingly readable, and the developer policy is especially clear: https://developer.twitter.com/en/developer-terms/policy. To see how easy it is to violate the terms under which an API provider makes data available, consider that we saved the tweets that we downloaded. If we were to push these to GitHub, then it is possible that we may have accidentally stored sensitive information if there happened to be some in the tweets. Twitter is also explicit about asking those that use their API to be especially careful about sensitive information and not matching Twitter users with off-Twitter folks. Again, the documentation around these restricted uses is clear and readable: https://developer.twitter.com/en/developer-terms/more-on-restricted-use-cases.



### Case study: Gathering data from Spotify

For the final case study, we will use `spotifyr` [@spotifyr], which is a wrapper around the Spotify API. Install `install.packages('spotifyr')` and load the package.


```r
library(spotifyr)
```

To access the Spotify API, we need a Spotify Developer Account: https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/. This will require logging in with a Spotify account and then accepting the Developer Terms (Figure \@ref(fig:spotifyaccept)).

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="/Users/rohanalexander/Documents/book/figures/spotify.png" alt="Spotify Developer Account Terms agreement page" width="90%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:spotifyaccept)Spotify Developer Account Terms agreement page</p>
</div>

Continuing with the registration process, in our case, we 'do not know' what we are building and so Spotify requires us to use a non-commercial agreement. To use the Spotify API we need a 'Client ID' and a 'Client Secret'. These are things that we want to keep to ourselves because anyone with the details could use our developer account as though they were us. One way to keep these details secret with a minimum of hassle is to keep them in our 'System Environment'. In this way, when we push to GitHub they should not be included. (We followed this process without explanation in Chapter \@ref(interactive-communication) when we used `mapdeck`.) We will use `usethis` [@citeusethis] to modify our System Environment. In particular, there is a file called '.Renviron' which we will open using `edit_r_environ()` and add our 'Client ID' and 'Client Secret' to.


```r
library(usethis)

edit_r_environ()
```

When we run `edit_r_environ()`, our '.Renviron' file will open and we can add our 'Spotify Client ID' and 'Client Secret'. It is important to use the same names, because `spotifyr` will look in our environment for keys with those specific names. 


```r
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID = 'PUT_YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE'
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET = 'PUT_YOUR_SECRET_HERE'
```

Save the '.Renviron' file, and then restart R ('Session' -> 'Restart R'). We can now use our 'Spotify Client ID' and 'Client Secret' as needed. And functions that require those details as arguments will work without them being explicitly specified again. We will get and save some information about Radiohead, the English rock band, using `get_artist_audio_features()`. One of the required arguments is `authorization`, but as that is set, by default, to look at the '.Renviron' file, we do not need to specify it here. 


```r
radiohead <- get_artist_audio_features('radiohead')
saveRDS(radiohead, "radiohead.rds")
```






```r
radiohead <- readRDS("radiohead.rds")
```

There is a variety of information available based on songs. We might be interested to see whether their songs are getting longer over time (Figure \@ref(fig:readioovertime)).


```r
radiohead |> 
  select(artist_name, track_name, album_name) |> 
  head()
#>   artist_name                    track_name   album_name
#> 1   Radiohead Everything In Its Right Place KID A MNESIA
#> 2   Radiohead                         Kid A KID A MNESIA
#> 3   Radiohead           The National Anthem KID A MNESIA
#> 4   Radiohead   How to Disappear Completely KID A MNESIA
#> 5   Radiohead                   Treefingers KID A MNESIA
#> 6   Radiohead                    Optimistic KID A MNESIA
```


```r
library(lubridate)

radiohead |> 
  mutate(album_release_date = ymd(album_release_date)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = album_release_date, y = duration_ms)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Album release date",
       y = "Duration of song (ms)"
       ) 
```

<div class="figure">
<img src="20-gather_files/figure-html/readioovertime-1.png" alt="Length of each Radiohead song, over time, as gathered from Spotify" width="672" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:readioovertime)Length of each Radiohead song, over time, as gathered from Spotify</p>
</div>

One interesting variable provided by Spotify about each song is 'valence'. The Spotify documentation describe this as a measure between 0 and 1 that signals the 'the musical positiveness' of the track with higher values being more positive. Further details are available at the documentation: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#/operations/get-audio-features. We might be interested to compare valence over time between a few artists, for instance, the American rock band The National, and the American singer Taylor Swift.

First, we need to gather the data.


```r
taylor_swift <- get_artist_audio_features('taylor swift')
the_national <- get_artist_audio_features('the national')

saveRDS(taylor_swift, "taylor_swift.rds")
saveRDS(the_national, "the_national.rds")
```







Then we can bring them together and make the graph (Figure \@ref(fig:swiftyvsnationalvsradiohead)). This appears to show that while Taylor Swift and Radiohead have largely maintained their level of valence overtime, The National has decreased theirs.


```r
three_artists <-
  rbind(taylor_swift, the_national, radiohead) |>
  select(artist_name, album_release_date, valence) |>
  mutate(album_release_date = ymd(album_release_date))

three_artists |>
  ggplot(aes(x = album_release_date,
             y = valence,
             color = artist_name)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Album release date",
       y = "Valence",
       color = "Artist") +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1")
```

<div class="figure">
<img src="20-gather_files/figure-html/swiftyvsnationalvsradiohead-1.png" alt="Comparing valence, over time, for Radiohead, Taylor Swift, and The National" width="672" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:swiftyvsnationalvsradiohead)Comparing valence, over time, for Radiohead, Taylor Swift, and The National</p>
</div>

How amazing that we live in a world that all that information is available with very little effort or cost. And having gathered the data, there is a lot that could be done. For instance, @kaylinpavlik uses an expanded dataset to classify musical genres and @theeconomistonspotify looks at how language is associated with music streaming on Spotify. Our ability to gather such data enables us to answer questions that had to be considered experimentally in the past, for instance @salganik2006experimental had to use experimental data rather than the real data we are able to access. But at the same time, it is worth thinking about what valence is purporting to represent. Little information is available in the Spotify documentation about how this is being created. And it is doubtful that one number can completely represent how positive a song is.

## Web scraping


Web scraping is a way to get data from websites. Rather than going to a website using a browser the copy and pasting, we write code that does it for us. This opens a lot of data to us, but on the other hand, it is not typically data that is being made available for these purposes. This means that it is important to be respectful of it. While generally not illegal, the specifics about the legality of web scraping depend on jurisdictions and the specifics of what we are doing, and so it is also important to be mindful of this. While our use would rarely be commercially competitive, of particular concern is the conflict between the need for our work to be reproducible with the need to respect terms of service that may disallow data republishing [@luscombe2021algorithmic]. And finally, web scraping imposes a cost on the website host, and so it is important to reduce this to the extent possible.

That all said, web scraping is an invaluable source of data. But they are typically datasets that can be created as a by-product of someone trying to achieve another aim. For instance, a retailer may have a website with their products and their prices. That has not been created deliberately as a source of data, but we can scrape it to create a dataset. As such, the following principles are useful to guide web scraping.

1. Avoid it. Try to use an API wherever possible.
2. Abide by their desires. Some websites have a 'robots.txt' file that contains information about what they are comfortable with scrapers doing, for instance 'https://www.google.com/robots.txt'. 
3. Reduce the impact. 
    - Firstly, slow down the scraper, for instance, rather than having it visit the website every second, slow it down using `sys.sleep()`. If we only need a few hundred files, then why not just have it visit the website a few times a minute, running in the background overnight?
   - Secondly, consider the timing of when we run our scraper. For instance, if we are scraping a retailer then maybe we should set our script to run from 10pm through to the morning, when fewer customers are likely using the site. Similarly, if it is a government website and they have a big monthly release, then it might be polite to avoid that day.
4. Take only what is needed. For instance, we do not need to scrape the entire of Wikipedia if all we need is the names of the ten largest cities in Croatia. This reduces the impact on the website, and allows us to more easily justify our actions.
5. Only scrape once. This means we should save everything as we go so that we do not have to re-collect data. Similarly, once we have the data, we should keep that separate and not modify it. Of course, if we need data over time then we will need to go back, but this is different to needlessly re-scraping a page.
6. Do not republish the pages that were scraped. (This contrasts with datasets that we create from it.)
7. Take ownership and ask permission if possible. At a minimum level all scripts should have our contact details in them. Depending on the circumstances, it may be worthwhile asking for permission before you scrape.



Web scraping is possible by taking advantage of the underlying structure of a webpage. We use patterns in the HTML/CSS to get the data that we want. To look at the underlying HTML/CSS we can either: 

1) open a browser, right-click, and choose something like 'Inspect'; or 
2) save the website and then open it with a text editor rather than a browser.

HTML/CSS is a markup language comprised of matching tags. If we want text to be bold, then we would use something like:


```css
<b>My bold text</b>
```

Similarly, if we want a list then we start and end the list, as well as each item. 


```css
<ul>
  <li>Learn webscraping</li>
  <li>Do data science</li>
  <li>Proft</li>
</ul>
```

When scraping we will search for these tags.

To get started, we can pretend that we obtained some HTML from a website, and that we want to get the name from it. We can see that the name is in bold, so we want to focus on that feature and extract it.


```r
website_extract <- "<p>Hi, Iâm <b>Rohan</b> Alexander.</p>"
```

We will use `read_html()` from `rvest` [@citervest] to read in the data. 


```r
# install.packages("rvest")
library(rvest)

rohans_data <- read_html(website_extract)

rohans_data
#> {html_document}
#> <html>
#> [1] <body><p>Hi, Iâm <b>Rohan</b> Alexander.</p></body>
```

The language used by `rvest` to look for tags is 'node', so we focus on bold nodes. By default `html_nodes()` returns the tags as well. We can focus on the text that they contain, with `html_text()`.


```r
rohans_data |> 
  html_nodes("b")
#> {xml_nodeset (1)}
#> [1] <b>Rohan</b>

first_name <- 
  rohans_data |> 
  html_nodes("b") |>
  html_text()

first_name
#> [1] "Rohan"
```



### Case study: Web scraping book information

In this case study we will scrape a list of books from: https://rohanalexander.com/bookshelf.html. We will then clean the data and look at the distribution of the first letters of author surnames. It is slightly more complicated than the example above, but the underlying approach is the same: download the website, look for the nodes of interest, extract the information, clean it.

We use `rvest` [@citervest] to download a website, and to then navigate the html to find the aspects that we are interested in. And we use `tidyverse` to clean the dataset. We first need to go to the website and then save a local copy.




```r
library(rvest)
library(tidyverse)
library(xml2)

books_data <- read_html("https://rohanalexander.com/bookshelf.html")

write_html(books_data, "raw_data.html") 
```

Now we need to navigate the HTML to get the aspects that we want, and to then put them into some sensible structure. We will start with trying to get the data into a tibble as quickly as possible because this will allow us to more easily use `dplyr` verbs and `tidyverse` functions.


```r
books_data <- read_html("inputs/my_website/raw_data.html")
```


```r
books_data
#> {html_document}
#> <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" lang="" xml:lang="">
#> [1] <head>\n<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text ...
#> [2] <body>\n\n<!--radix_placeholder_front_matter-->\n\n<s ...
```

To get the data into a tibble we first need to identify the data that we are interested in using html tags. If we look at the website then we need to focus on list items (Figure \@ref(fig:rohansbooks)). And we can look at the source, focusing particularly on looking for a list (Figure \@ref(fig:rohanssourceone)).

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="/Users/rohanalexander/Documents/book/figures/rohansbooks.png" alt="Books website as displayed" width="90%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:rohansbooks)Books website as displayed</p>
</div>

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="/Users/rohanalexander/Documents/book/figures/sourcetop.png" alt="HTML for the top of the books website and the list of books" width="50%" /><img src="/Users/rohanalexander/Documents/book/figures/sourcelist.png" alt="HTML for the top of the books website and the list of books" width="50%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:rohanssourceone)HTML for the top of the books website and the list of books</p>
</div>

The tag for a list item is 'li', so we can use that to focus on the list.


```r
text_data <- 
  books_data |>
  html_nodes("li") |>
  html_text()

all_books <- 
  tibble(books = text_data)

head(all_books)
#> # A tibble: 6 Ã 1
#>   books                     
#>   <chr>                     
#> 1 Academic                  
#> 2 Non-fiction               
#> 3 Fiction                   
#> 4 Cookbooks                 
#> 5 Want to buy               
#> 6 Best books that I read in:
```

We now need to clean the data. First we want to separate the title and the author using `separate()` and then clean up the author and title columns.


```r
all_books <-
  all_books |>
  slice(7:nrow(all_books)) |>
  separate(books, into = c("author", "title"), sep = ", â")

all_books <-
  all_books |>
  separate(title, into = c("title", "debris"), sep = "â.") |>
  select(-debris) |>
  mutate(author = str_remove_all(author, "^, "),
         author = str_squish(author),
         title = str_remove(title, "â"),
         title = str_remove(title, "^-")
         )

head(all_books)
#> # A tibble: 6 Ã 2
#>   author                               title                
#>   <chr>                                <chr>                
#> 1 Bryant, John, and Junni L. Zhang     Bayesian Demographicâ¦
#> 2 Chan, Ngai Hang                      Time Series          
#> 3 Clark, Greg                          The Son Also Rises   
#> 4 Duflo, Esther                        ExpÃ©rience, science â¦
#> 5 Foster, Ghani, Jarmin, Kreuter, Lane Big Data and Social â¦
#> 6 Francois Chollet with JJ Allaire     Deep Learning with R
```

<!-- Finally, some specific cleaning is needed. -->

<!-- ```{r, include = TRUE, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE} -->
<!-- all_books <- -->
<!--   all_books |> -->
<!--   mutate(author = str_replace_all(author, -->
<!--                               c("J. K. Rowling." = "J K Rowling.", -->
<!--                                 "M. Mitchell Waldrop." = "M Mitchell Waldrop.", -->
<!--                                 "David A. Price" = "David A Price") -->
<!--                               ) -->
<!--          ) |> -->
<!--   separate(author, into = c("author_correct", "throw_away"), sep = "\\.", extra = "drop") |> -->
<!--   select(-throw_away) |> -->
<!--   rename(author = author_correct) -->

<!-- # One has multiple authors: -->
<!-- # "Daniela Witten, Gareth James, Robert Tibshirani, and Trevor Hastie" -->
<!-- all_books <- -->
<!--   all_books |> -->
<!--   mutate(author = str_replace(author, -->
<!--                               "Daniela Witten, Gareth James, Robert Tibshirani, and Trevor Hastie", -->
<!--                               "Daniela Witten and Gareth James and Robert Tibshirani and Trevor Hastie")) |> -->
<!--   separate(author, into = c("author_first", "author_second", "author_third", "author_fourth"), sep = " and ", fill = "right") |> -->
<!--   pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("author_"), -->
<!--                names_to = "author_position", -->
<!--                values_to = "author") |> -->
<!--   select(-author_position) |> -->
<!--   filter(!is.na(author)) -->

<!-- head(all_books) -->
<!-- ``` -->

There are some at the end that we need to get rid of because they are from a 'best of'. 


```r
all_books <- 
  all_books |> 
  slice(1:142) |>
  filter(author != "â150 Years of Stats Canada!â.")
```

Finally, we could make a table of the distribution of the first letter of the names (Table \@ref(tab:lettersofbooks)).


```r
all_books |> 
  mutate(
    first_letter = str_sub(author, 1, 1)
    ) |> 
  group_by(first_letter) |> 
  count() |>
  knitr::kable(
    caption = "Distribution of first letter of author names in a collection of books",
    col.names = c("First letter", "Number of times"),
    booktabs = TRUE, 
    linesep = ""
    )
```



Table: (\#tab:lettersofbooks)Distribution of first letter of author names in a collection of books

|First letter | Number of times|
|:------------|---------------:|
|â­           |              12|
|A            |               6|
|B            |               8|
|C            |              13|

### Case study: Web scraping UK Prime Ministers from Wikipedia

In this case study we are interested in how long UK prime ministers lived, based on the year that they were born. We will scrape data from Wikipedia using `rvest` [@citervest], clean it, and then make a graph. Every time we scrape a website things will change. Each scrape will largely be bespoke, even if we can borrow some code from earlier projects. It is completely normal to feel frustrated at times. It helps to begin with an end in mind. 

To that end, we can start by generating some simulated data. Ideally, we want a table that has a row for each prime minister, a column for their name, and a column each for the birth and death years. If they are still alive, then that death year can be empty. We know that birth and death years should be somewhere between 1700 and 1990, and that death year should be larger than birth year. Finally, we also know that the years should be integers, and the names should be characters. So, we want something that looks roughly like this:


```r
library(babynames)

set.seed(853)

simulated_dataset <-
  tibble(
    prime_minister = sample(
      x = babynames |> filter(prop > 0.01) |>
        select(name) |> unique() |> unlist(),
      size = 10,
      replace = FALSE
    ),
    birth_year = sample(
      x = c(1700:1990),
      size = 10,
      replace = TRUE
    ),
    years_lived = sample(
      x = c(50:100),
      size = 10,
      replace = TRUE
    ),
    death_year = birth_year + years_lived
  ) |>
  select(prime_minister, birth_year, death_year, years_lived) |>
  arrange(birth_year)
```

One of the advantages of generating a simulated dataset is that if we are working in groups then one person can start making the graph, using the simulated dataset, while the other person gathers the data. In terms of a graph, we are aiming for something like Figure \@ref(fig:pmsgraphexample).

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="/Users/rohanalexander/Documents/book/figures/pms_graph_plan.png" alt="Sketch of planned graph showing how long UK prime ministers lived" width="90%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:pmsgraphexample)Sketch of planned graph showing how long UK prime ministers lived</p>
</div>

We are starting with a question that is of interest, which how long each UK prime minister lived. As such, we need to identify a source of data While there are plenty of data sources that have the births and deaths of each prime minister, we want one that we can trust, and as we are going to be scraping, we want one that has some structure to it. The Wikipedia page about UK prime ministers fits both these criteria: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_prime_ministers_of_the_United_Kingdom. As it is a popular page the information is more likely to be correct, and the data are available in a table.

We load `rvest` and then download the page using `read_html()`. Saving it locally provides us with a copy that we need for reproducibility in case the website changes, and also means that we do not have to keep visiting the website. But it is likely not our property, and so this is typically not something that should be necessarily redistributed.


```r
library(rvest)
library(tidyverse)
```




```r
raw_data <-
  read_html("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_prime_ministers_of_the_United_Kingdom")
write_html(raw_data, "pms.html")
```

As with the earlier case study we are looking for patterns in the HTML that we can use to help us get closer to the data that we want. This is an iterative process and requires a lot of trial and error. Even simple examples will take time. 

One tool that may help is the SelectorGadget: https://rvest.tidyverse.org/articles/articles/selectorgadget.html. This allows us to pick and choose the elements that we want, and then gives us the input to give to `html_nodes()` (Figure \@ref(fig:selectorgadget))

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="/Users/rohanalexander/Documents/book/figures/uk_pms.png" alt="Using the Selector Gadget to identify the tag, as at 13 March 2020." width="90%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:selectorgadget)Using the Selector Gadget to identify the tag, as at 13 March 2020.</p>
</div>





```r
# Read in our saved data
raw_data <- read_html("pms.html")
```




```r
# We can parse tags in order
parse_data_selector_gadget <- 
  raw_data |> 
  html_nodes("td:nth-child(3)") |> 
  html_text()

head(parse_data_selector_gadget)
#> [1] "\nSir Robert Walpole(1676â1745)\n"                       
#> [2] "\nSpencer Compton1st Earl of Wilmington(1673â1743)\n"    
#> [3] "\nHenry Pelham(1694â1754)\n"                             
#> [4] "\nThomas Pelham-Holles1st Duke of Newcastle(1693â1768)\n"
#> [5] "\nWilliam Cavendish4th Duke of Devonshire(1720â1764)\n"  
#> [6] "\nThomas Pelham-Holles1st Duke of Newcastle(1693â1768)\n"
```

In this case there is are a few blank lines that  we will need to filter away.


```r
parsed_data <-
  tibble(raw_text = parse_data_selector_gadget) |>
  filter(raw_text != "â\n") |>
  filter(
    !raw_text %in% c(
      "\n1868\n",
      "\n1874\n",
      "\n1880\n",
      "\n1885\n",
      "\n1892\n",
      "\n1979\n",
      "\n1997\n",
      "\n2010\n"
    )
  ) |>
  filter(
    !raw_text %in% c(
      "\nNational Labour\n",
      "\nWilliam Pulteney1st Earl of Bath(1684â1764)\n",
      "\nJames Waldegrave2nd Earl Waldegrave(1715â1763)\n",
      "\nEdward VII\n\n\n1901â1910\n\n", 
      "\nGeorge V\n\n\n1910â1936\n\n"
    )
  )

head(parsed_data)
#> # A tibble: 6 Ã 1
#>   raw_text                                                  
#>   <chr>                                                     
#> 1 "\nSir Robert Walpole(1676â1745)\n"                       
#> 2 "\nSpencer Compton1st Earl of Wilmington(1673â1743)\n"    
#> 3 "\nHenry Pelham(1694â1754)\n"                             
#> 4 "\nThomas Pelham-Holles1st Duke of Newcastle(1693â1768)\n"
#> 5 "\nWilliam Cavendish4th Duke of Devonshire(1720â1764)\n"  
#> 6 "\nThomas Pelham-Holles1st Duke of Newcastle(1693â1768)\n"
```

Now that we have the parsed data, we need to clean it to match what we wanted. In particular we want a names column, as well as columns for birth year and death year. We will use `separate()` to take advantage of the fact that it looks like the dates are distinguished by brackets.


```r
initial_clean <- 
  parsed_data |> 
  mutate(raw_text = str_remove_all(raw_text, "\n")) |>
  separate(raw_text, 
            into = c("Name", "not_name"), 
            sep = "\\(",
            remove = FALSE) |> # The remove = FALSE option here means that we 
  # keep the original column that we are separating.
  separate(not_name, 
            into = c("Date", "all_the_rest"), 
            sep = "\\)",
            remove = FALSE)

head(initial_clean)
#> # A tibble: 6 Ã 5
#>   raw_text                 Name  not_name Date  all_the_rest
#>   <chr>                    <chr> <chr>    <chr> <chr>       
#> 1 Sir Robert Walpole(1676â¦ Sir â¦ 1676â17â¦ 1676â¦ ""          
#> 2 Spencer Compton1st Earlâ¦ Spenâ¦ 1673â17â¦ 1673â¦ ""          
#> 3 Henry Pelham(1694â1754)  Henrâ¦ 1694â17â¦ 1694â¦ ""          
#> 4 Thomas Pelham-Holles1stâ¦ Thomâ¦ 1693â17â¦ 1693â¦ ""          
#> 5 William Cavendish4th Duâ¦ Willâ¦ 1720â17â¦ 1720â¦ ""          
#> 6 Thomas Pelham-Holles1stâ¦ Thomâ¦ 1693â17â¦ 1693â¦ ""
```

Finally, we need to clean up the columns.


```r
initial_clean <- 
 initial_clean |> 
  separate(col = Name, 
           into = c("Name", "Title"),
           sep = "[[:digit:]]",
           extra = "merge",
           fill = "right") |>
  separate(col = Name, 
           into = c("Name", "Title"),
           sep = "MP for",
           extra = "merge",
           fill = "right") |>
  mutate(Name = str_remove(Name, "\\[b\\]"))

head(initial_clean)
#> # A tibble: 6 Ã 6
#>   raw_text           Name  Title not_name Date  all_the_rest
#>   <chr>              <chr> <chr> <chr>    <chr> <chr>       
#> 1 Sir Robert Walpolâ¦ Sir â¦ <NA>  1676â17â¦ 1676â¦ ""          
#> 2 Spencer Compton1sâ¦ Spenâ¦ <NA>  1673â17â¦ 1673â¦ ""          
#> 3 Henry Pelham(1694â¦ Henrâ¦ <NA>  1694â17â¦ 1694â¦ ""          
#> 4 Thomas Pelham-Holâ¦ Thomâ¦ <NA>  1693â17â¦ 1693â¦ ""          
#> 5 William Cavendishâ¦ Willâ¦ <NA>  1720â17â¦ 1720â¦ ""          
#> 6 Thomas Pelham-Holâ¦ Thomâ¦ <NA>  1693â17â¦ 1693â¦ ""
```



```r
cleaned_data <- 
  initial_clean |> 
  select(Name, Date) |> 
  separate(Date, into = c("Birth", "Died"), sep = "â", remove = FALSE) |> # The 
  # PMs who have died have their birth and death years separated by a hyphen, but 
  # we need to be careful with the hyphen as it seems to be a slightly odd type of 
  # hyphen and we need to copy/paste it.
  mutate(Birth = str_remove_all(Birth, "born"),
         Birth = str_trim(Birth)
         ) |> # Alive PMs have slightly different format
  select(-Date) |> 
  mutate(Name = str_remove(Name, "\n")) |> # Remove some html tags that remain
  mutate_at(vars(Birth, Died), ~as.integer(.)) |> # Change birth and death to integers
  mutate(Age_at_Death = Died - Birth) |>  # Add column of the number of years they lived
  distinct() # Some of the PMs had two goes at it.

head(cleaned_data)
#> # A tibble: 6 Ã 4
#>   Name                 Birth  Died Age_at_Death
#>   <chr>                <int> <int>        <int>
#> 1 Sir Robert Walpole    1676  1745           69
#> 2 Spencer Compton       1673  1743           70
#> 3 Henry Pelham          1694  1754           60
#> 4 Thomas Pelham-Holles  1693  1768           75
#> 5 William Cavendish     1720  1764           44
#> 6 John Stuart           1713  1792           79
```

Our dataset looks similar to the one that we said we wanted at the start (Table \@ref(tab:canadianpmscleanddata)).


```r
cleaned_data |> 
  knitr::kable(
    caption = "UK Prime Ministers, by how old they were when they died",
    col.names = c("Prime Minister", "Birth year", "Death year", "Age at death"),
    booktabs = TRUE, 
    linesep = ""
    )
```

At this point we would like to make a graph that illustrates how long each prime minister lived. If they are still alive then we would like them to run to the end, but we would like to color them differently.


```r
cleaned_data |> 
  mutate(still_alive = if_else(is.na(Died), "Yes", "No"),
         Died = if_else(is.na(Died), as.integer(2022), Died)) |> 
  mutate(Name = as_factor(Name)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = Birth, 
             xend = Died,
             y = Name,
             yend = Name, 
             color = still_alive)) +
  geom_segment() +
  labs(x = "Year of birth",
       y = "Prime minister",
       color = "PM is alive",
       title = "How long each UK Prime Minister lived, by year of birth") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1")
```

### Case study: Downloading multiple files

Considering text as data is exciting and opens up a lot of different research questions. Many guides assume that we already have a nicely formatted text dataset, but that is rarely actually the case. In this case study we will download files from a few different pages. While we have already seen two examples of web scraping, those were focused on just one page, whereas we often need many. Here we will focus on this iteration. We will use `download.file()` to do the download, and `purrr` [@citepurrr] to apply this function across multiple sites.

The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) is Australia's central bank and sets monetary policy. It has responsibility for setting the cash rate, which is the interest rate used for loans between banks. This interest rate is an especially important one, and has a large impact on the other interest rates in the economy. Four times a year -- February, May, August, and November -- the RBA publishes a statement on monetary policy, and these are available as PDFs. In this example we will download the four statements published in 2021.

First we set-up a dataframe that has the information that we need.


```r
library(tidyverse)

statements_of_interest <- 
  tibble(
    address = c("https://www.rba.gov.au/publications/smp/2021/nov/pdf/00-overview.pdf",
                "https://www.rba.gov.au/publications/smp/2021/aug/pdf/00-overview.pdf",
                "https://www.rba.gov.au/publications/smp/2021/may/pdf/00-overview.pdf",
                "https://www.rba.gov.au/publications/smp/2021/feb/pdf/00-overview.pdf"
                ),
    local_save_name = c(
      "2021-11.pdf",
      "2021-08.pdf",
      "2021-05.pdf",
      "2021-02.pdf"
    )
  )

statements_of_interest
#> # A tibble: 4 Ã 2
#>   address                                    local_save_name
#>   <chr>                                      <chr>          
#> 1 https://www.rba.gov.au/publications/smp/2â¦ 2021-11.pdf    
#> 2 https://www.rba.gov.au/publications/smp/2â¦ 2021-08.pdf    
#> 3 https://www.rba.gov.au/publications/smp/2â¦ 2021-05.pdf    
#> 4 https://www.rba.gov.au/publications/smp/2â¦ 2021-02.pdf
```

Then we can apply the function `download.files()` to these four 

Then we can write a function that will download the file, let us know that it was downloaded, wait a polite amount of time, and then go get the next file. 



```r
visit_download_and_wait <-
  function(the_address_to_visit, where_to_save_it_locally) {
    
    download.file(url = the_address_to_visit,
                  destfile = where_to_save_it_locally
                  )

    print(paste("Done with", the_address_to_visit, "at", Sys.time()))
    
    Sys.sleep(sample(5:10, 1))
  }
```

We now apply that function to our list of URLs.


```r
walk2(statements_of_interest$address,
      statements_of_interest$local_save_name,
      ~visit_download_and_wait(.x, .y))
```

The result is that we have downloaded these four PDFs and saved them to our computer. In the next section we will build on this to discuss getting information from these PDFs.


## PDFs

In contrast to an API, a PDF is usually only produced for human rather than computer consumption. The nice thing about PDFs is that they are static and constant. And it is nice that they make data available at all. But the trade-off is that:

- It is not overly useful to do larger-scale statistical analysis.
- We do not know how the PDF was put together so we do not know whether we can trust it.
- We cannot manipulate the data to get results that we are interested in.



Indeed, sometimes governments publish data as PDFs because they do not actually want us to be able to analyze it. Being able to get data from PDFs opens up a large number of datasets.

There are two important aspects to keep in mind when approaching a PDF with a mind to extracting data from it:

1. Begin with an end in mind. Planning and then literally sketching out what we want from a final dataset/graph/paper stops us wasting time and keeps us focused. 
2. Start simple, then iterate. The quickest way to make a complicated model is often to first build a simple model and then complicate it. Start with just trying to get one page of the PDF working or even just one line. Then iterate from there.

We will start by walking through several examples and then go through a case study where we will gather data on US Total Fertility Rate, by state.

Figure \@ref(fig:firstpdfexample) is a PDF that consists of just the first sentence from Jane Eyre taken from Project Gutenberg [@janeeyre].

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="/Users/rohanalexander/Documents/book/inputs/pdfs/first_example.png" alt="First sentence of Jane Eyre" width="90%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:firstpdfexample)First sentence of Jane Eyre</p>
</div>

If assume that it was saved as 'first_example.pdf', then we can `pdftools` [@citepdftools] to get the text from this one-page PDF into R.



```r
library(pdftools)
library(tidyverse)

first_example <- pdf_text("first_example.pdf")

first_example

class(first_example)
```



We can see that the PDF has been correctly read in, as a character vector.

We will now try a slightly more complicated example that consists of the first few paragraphs of Jane Eyre (Figure \@ref(fig:secondpdfexample)). Also notice that now we have the chapter heading as well.

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="/Users/rohanalexander/Documents/book/inputs/pdfs/second_example.png" alt="First few paragraphs of Jane Eyre" width="90%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:secondpdfexample)First few paragraphs of Jane Eyre</p>
</div>

We use the same function as before.


```r
second_example <- pdftools::pdf_text("second_example.pdf")

second_example

class(second_example)
```



Again, we have a character vector. The end of each line is signaled by '\\n', but other than that it looks pretty good. Finally, we consider the first two pages.


```r
third_example <- pdftools::pdf_text("third_example.pdf")

third_example

class(third_example)
```




Notice that the first page is the first element of the character vector, and the second page is the second element. As we are most familiar with rectangular data, we will try to get it into that format as quickly as possible. And then we can use our regular `tidyverse` functions to deal with it.

First we want to convert the character vector into a tibble. At this point we may like to add page numbers as well.


```r
jane_eyre <- tibble(raw_text = third_example,
                    page_number = c(1:2))
```

We then want to separate the lines so that each line is an observation. We can do that by looking for '\\n' remembering that we need to escape the backslash as it is a special character.


```r
jane_eyre <- 
  separate_rows(jane_eyre, raw_text, sep = "\\n", convert = FALSE)
jane_eyre
#> # A tibble: 93 Ã 2
#>    raw_text                                      page_number
#>    <chr>                                               <int>
#>  1 "CHAPTER I"                                             1
#>  2 "There was no possibility of taking a walk tâ¦           1
#>  3 "leafless shrubbery an hour in the morning; â¦           1
#>  4 "company, dined early) the cold winter wind â¦           1
#>  5 "penetrating, that further out-door exerciseâ¦           1
#>  6 ""                                                      1
#>  7 "I was glad of it: I never liked long walks,â¦           1
#>  8 "coming home in the raw twilight, with nippeâ¦           1
#>  9 "chidings of Bessie, the nurse, and humbled â¦           1
#> 10 "Eliza, John, and Georgiana Reed."                      1
#> # â¦ with 83 more rows
```







### Case-study: Gathering data on the US Total Fertility Rate

The US Department of Health and Human Services Vital Statistics Report provides information about the total fertility rate (the average number of births per woman if women experience the current age-specific fertility rates throughout their reproductive years) for each state for nineteen years. The US persists in only making this data available in PDFs, which hinders research. But we can use the approaches above to get the data into a nice dataset.

For instance, in the case of the year 2000 the table that we are interested in is on page 40 of a PDF that is available at https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr50/nvsr50_05.pdf. The column of interest is labelled: "Total fertility rate" (Figure \@ref(fig:dhsexample)). 

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="/Users/rohanalexander/Documents/book/figures/dhs_example.png" alt="Example Vital Statistics Report, from 2000" width="90%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:dhsexample)Example Vital Statistics Report, from 2000</p>
</div>

The first step when getting data out of a PDF is to sketch out what we eventually want. A PDF typically contains a lot of information, and so it is handy to be very clear about what you need. This helps keep you focused, and prevents scope creep, but it is also helpful when thinking about data checks. We literally write down on paper what we have in mind. In this case, what is needed is a table with a column for state, year and TFR (Figure \@ref(fig:tfrdesired)). 

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="/Users/rohanalexander/Documents/book/figures/tfr_dataset_sketch.png" alt="Planned dataset of TFR for each year and US state" width="40%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:tfrdesired)Planned dataset of TFR for each year and US state</p>
</div>

There are 19 different PDFs, and we are interested in a particular column in a particular table in each of them. Unfortunately, there is nothing magical about what is coming. This first step requires working out the link for each, and the page and column name that is of interest. In the end, this looks like this.





```r
summary_tfr_dataset |> 
  select(year, page, table, column_name, url) |> 
  gt()
```

```

The first step is to get some code that works for one of them. I'll step through the code in a lot more detail than normal because we're going to use these pieces a lot. 

We will choose the year 2000. We first download and save the PDF using `download.file()`.


```r
download.file(url = summary_tfr_dataset$url[1], 
              destfile = "year_2000.pdf")
```


```r
# INTERNAL
download.file(url = summary_tfr_dataset$url[1], 
              destfile = "inputs/pdfs/dhs/year_2000.pdf")
```

We then read the PDF in as a character vector using `pdf_text()` from `pdftools`. And then convert it to a tibble, so that we can use familiar verbs on it.


```r
library(pdftools)
dhs_2000 <- pdf_text("year_2000.pdf")
```




```r
dhs_2000 <- tibble(raw_data = dhs_2000)

head(dhs_2000)
#> # A tibble: 6 Ã 1
#>   raw_data                                                  
#>   <chr>                                                     
#> 1 "Volume 50, Number 5                                     â¦
#> 2 "2   National Vital Statistics Report, Vol. 50, No. 5, Feâ¦
#> 3 "                                                        â¦
#> 4 "4   National Vital Statistics Report, Vol. 50, No. 5, Feâ¦
#> 5 "                                                        â¦
#> 6 "6   National Vital Statistics Report, Vol. 50, No. 5, Feâ¦
```

Grab the page that is of interest (remembering that each page is a element of the character vector, hence a row in the tibble).


```r
dhs_2000 <- 
  dhs_2000 |> 
  slice(summary_tfr_dataset$page[1])

head(dhs_2000)
#> # A tibble: 1 Ã 1
#>   raw_data                                                  
#>   <chr>                                                     
#> 1 "40 National Vital Statistics Report, Vol. 50, No. 5, Revâ¦
```

Now we want to separate the rows.


```r
dhs_2000 <- 
  dhs_2000 |> 
  separate_rows(raw_data, sep = "\\n", convert = FALSE)

head(dhs_2000)
#> # A tibble: 6 Ã 1
#>   raw_data                                                  
#>   <chr>                                                     
#> 1 "40 National Vital Statistics Report, Vol. 50, No. 5, Revâ¦
#> 2 ""                                                        
#> 3 "Table 10. Number of births, birth rates, fertility ratesâ¦
#> 4 "United States, each State and territory, 2000"           
#> 5 "[By place of residence. Birth rates are live births per â¦
#> 6 "estimated in each area; total fertility rates are sums oâ¦
```

Now we are searching for patterns that we can use. Let us look at the first ten lines of content.


```r
dhs_2000[13:22,]
#> # A tibble: 10 Ã 1
#>    raw_data                                                 
#>    <chr>                                                    
#>  1 "                                  State                â¦
#>  2 "                                                       â¦
#>  3 "                                                       â¦
#>  4 ""                                                       
#>  5 ""                                                       
#>  6 "United States 1 .......................................â¦
#>  7 ""                                                       
#>  8 "Alabama ...............................................â¦
#>  9 "Alaska ................................................â¦
#> 10 "Arizona ...............................................â¦
```

It does not get much better than this:

1. We have dots separating the states from the data.
2. We have a space between each of the columns.

So we can now separate this in to separate columns. First we want to match on when there is at least two dots (remembering that the dot is a special character and so needs to be escaped).


```r
dhs_2000 <- 
  dhs_2000 |> 
  separate(col = raw_data, 
           into = c("state", "data"), 
           sep = "\\.{2,}", 
           remove = FALSE,
           fill = "right"
           )

head(dhs_2000)
#> # A tibble: 6 Ã 3
#>   raw_data                                       state data 
#>   <chr>                                          <chr> <chr>
#> 1 "40 National Vital Statistics Report, Vol. 50â¦ "40 â¦ <NA> 
#> 2 ""                                             ""    <NA> 
#> 3 "Table 10. Number of births, birth rates, ferâ¦ "Tabâ¦ <NA> 
#> 4 "United States, each State and territory, 200â¦ "Uniâ¦ <NA> 
#> 5 "[By place of residence. Birth rates are liveâ¦ "[Byâ¦ <NA> 
#> 6 "estimated in each area; total fertility rateâ¦ "estâ¦ <NA>
```

We get the expected warnings about the top and the bottom as they do not have multiple dots. (Another option here is to use `pdf_data()` which would allow us to use location rather than delimiters.)

We can now separate the data based on spaces. There is an inconsistent number of spaces, so we first squish any example of more than one space into just one.


```r
dhs_2000 <- 
  dhs_2000 |>
  mutate(data = str_squish(data)) |> 
  tidyr::separate(col = data, 
           into = c("number_of_births", 
                    "birth_rate", 
                    "fertility_rate", 
                    "TFR", 
                    "teen_births_all", 
                    "teen_births_15_17", 
                    "teen_births_18_19"), 
           sep = "\\s", 
           remove = FALSE
           )

head(dhs_2000)
#> # A tibble: 6 Ã 10
#>   raw_data           state data  number_of_births birth_rate
#>   <chr>              <chr> <chr> <chr>            <chr>     
#> 1 "40 National Vitaâ¦ "40 â¦ <NA>  <NA>             <NA>      
#> 2 ""                 ""    <NA>  <NA>             <NA>      
#> 3 "Table 10. Numberâ¦ "Tabâ¦ <NA>  <NA>             <NA>      
#> 4 "United States, eâ¦ "Uniâ¦ <NA>  <NA>             <NA>      
#> 5 "[By place of resâ¦ "[Byâ¦ <NA>  <NA>             <NA>      
#> 6 "estimated in eacâ¦ "estâ¦ <NA>  <NA>             <NA>

#> #   teen_births_all <chr>, teen_births_15_17 <chr>,
#> #   teen_births_18_19 <chr>
```

This is all looking fairly great. The only thing left is to clean up.


```r
dhs_2000 <- 
  dhs_2000 |> 
  select(state, TFR) |> 
  slice(13:69) |> 
  mutate(year = 2000)

dhs_2000
#> # A tibble: 57 Ã 3
#>    state                                         TFR    year
#>    <chr>                                         <chr> <dbl>

#> # â¦ with 47 more rows
```

And we're done for that year. Now we want to take these pieces, put them into a function and then run that function over all 19 years.

The first part is downloading each of the 19 PDFs that we need. We are going to build on the code that we used before. That code was:


```r
download.file(url = summary_tfr_dataset$url[1], destfile = "year_2000.pdf")
```


To modify this we need:

1. To have it iterate through each of the lines in the dataset that contains our CSVs (i.e. where it says 1, we want 1, then 2, then 3, etc.). 
2. Where it has a filename, we need it to iterate through our desired filenames (i.e. year_2000, then year_2001, then year_2002, etc). 
3. We would like for it to do all of this in a way that is a little robust to errors. For instance, if one of the URLs is wrong or the internet drops out then we would like it to just move onto the next PDF, and then warn us at the end that it missed one, not to stop. (This does not really matter because it is only 19 files, but it is easy to find oneself doing this for thousands of files). 

We will draw on `purrr` for this [@citepurrr].


```r
library(purrr)

summary_tfr_dataset <- 
  summary_tfr_dataset |> 
  mutate(pdf_name = paste0("dhs/year_", year, ".pdf"))
```




```r
walk2(
  summary_tfr_dataset$url,
  summary_tfr_dataset$pdf_name,
  safely( ~ download.file(.x , .y))
)
```

Here we take `download.file()` and pass it two arguments: `.x` and `.y`. Then `walk2()` applies that function to the inputs that we give it, in this case the URLs columns is the `.x` and the pdf_names column is the `.y`. Finally, `safely()` means that if there are any failures then it just moves onto the next file instead of throwing an error.

We now have each of the PDFs saved and we can move onto getting the data from them.

Now we need to get the data from the PDFs. As before, we are going to build on the code that we used before. That code (overly condensed) was:


```r
dhs_2000 <- pdftools::pdf_text("year_2000.pdf")

dhs_2000 <-
  tibble(raw_data = dhs_2000) |>
  slice(summary_tfr_dataset$page[1]) |>
  separate_rows(raw_data, sep = "\\n", convert = FALSE) |>
  separate(
    col = raw_data,
    into = c("state", "data"),
    sep = "\\.{2,}",
    remove = FALSE
  ) |>
  mutate(data = str_squish(data)) |>
  separate(
    col = data,
    into = c(
      "number_of_births",
      "birth_rate",
      "fertility_rate",
      "TFR",
      "teen_births_all",
      "teen_births_15_17",
      "teen_births_18_19"
    ),
    sep = "\\s",
    remove = FALSE
  ) |>
  select(state, TFR) |>
  slice(13:69) |>
  mutate(year = 2000)

dhs_2000
```

The first thing that we want to iterate is the argument to `pdf_text()`, then the number in in `slice()` will also need to change (that is doing the work to get only the page that we are interested in).

Two aspects are hardcoded, and these may need to be updated. In particular: 

1) The separate only works if each of the tables has the same columns in the same order; and 
2) the slice (which restricts the data to just the states) only works in this case. 

Finally, we add the year only at the end, whereas we would need to bring that up earlier in the process. 

We will start by writing a function that will go through all the files, grab the data, get the page of interest, and then expand the rows. We will then use `pmap_dfr()` from `purrr` to apply that function to all of the PDFs and to output a tibble.


```r
get_pdf_convert_to_tibble <- function(pdf_name, page, year){
  
  dhs_table_of_interest <- 
    tibble(raw_data = pdftools::pdf_text(pdf_name)) |> 
    slice(page) |> 
    separate_rows(raw_data, sep = "\\n", convert = FALSE) |> 
    separate(col = raw_data, 
             into = c("state", "data"), 
             sep = "[ï¿½|\\.]\\s+(?=[[:digit:]])", 
             remove = FALSE) |> 
    mutate(
      data = str_squish(data),
      year_of_data = year)

  print(paste("Done with", year))
  
  return(dhs_table_of_interest)
}

raw_dhs_data <- purrr::pmap_dfr(summary_tfr_dataset |> select(pdf_name, page, year),
                                get_pdf_convert_to_tibble)

Now we need to clean up the state names and then filter on them.


```r
states <- c("Alabama", "Alaska", "Arizona", "Arkansas", "California", "Colorado", 
            "Connecticut", "Delaware", "Florida", "Georgia", "Hawaii", "Idaho", 
            "Illinois", "Indiana", "Iowa", "Kansas", "Kentucky", "Louisiana", 
            "Maine", "Maryland", "Massachusetts", "Michigan", "Minnesota", 
            "Mississippi", "Missouri", "Montana", "Nebraska", "Nevada", 
            "New Hampshire", "New Jersey", "New Mexico", "New York", "North Carolina", 
            "North Dakota", "Ohio", "Oklahoma", "Oregon", "Pennsylvania", 
            "Rhode Island", "South Carolina", "South Dakota", "Tennessee", "Texas", 
            "Utah", "Vermont", "Virginia", "Washington", "West Virginia", "Wisconsin", 
            "Wyoming", "District of Columbia")

raw_dhs_data <- 
  raw_dhs_data |> 
  mutate(state = str_remove_all(state, "\\."),
         state = str_remove_all(state, "ï¿½"),
         state = str_remove_all(state, "\u0008"),
         state = str_replace_all(state, "United States 1", "United States"),
         state = str_replace_all(state, "United States1", "United States"),
         state = str_replace_all(state, "United States 2", "United States"),
         state = str_replace_all(state, "United States2", "United States"),
         state = str_replace_all(state, "United StatesÂ²", "United States"),
         ) |> 
  mutate(state = str_squish(state)) |> 
  filter(state %in% states)

head(raw_dhs_data)
#> # A tibble: 6 Ã 4
#>   raw_data                          state data  year_of_data
#>   <chr>                             <chr> <chr>        <dbl>
#> 1 Alabama ........................â¦ Alabâ¦ 63,2â¦         2000
#> 2 Alaska .........................â¦ Alasâ¦ 9,97â¦         2000
#> 3 Arizona ........................â¦ Arizâ¦ 85,2â¦         2000
#> 4 Arkansas .......................â¦ Arkaâ¦ 37,7â¦         2000
#> 5 California .....................â¦ Caliâ¦ 531,â¦         2000
#> 6 Colorado .......................â¦ Coloâ¦ 65,4â¦         2000
```

The next step is to separate the data and get the correct column from it. We are going to separate based on spaces once it is cleaned up.



```r
raw_dhs_data <- 
  raw_dhs_data |> 
  mutate(data = str_remove_all(data, "\\*")) |> 
  separate(data, into = c("col_1", "col_2", "col_3", "col_4", "col_5", 
                          "col_6", "col_7", "col_8", "col_9", "col_10"), 
           sep = " ",
           remove = FALSE)
head(raw_dhs_data)
#> # A tibble: 6 Ã 14
#>   raw_data   state data  col_1 col_2 col_3 col_4 col_5 col_6
#>   <chr>      <chr> <chr> <chr> <chr> <chr> <chr> <chr> <chr>
#> 1 Alabama .â¦ Alabâ¦ 63,2â¦ 63,2â¦ 14.4  65.0  2,02â¦ 62.9  37.9 
#> 2 Alaska ..â¦ Alasâ¦ 9,97â¦ 9,974 16.0  74.6  2,43â¦ 42.4  23.6 
#> 3 Arizona .â¦ Arizâ¦ 85,2â¦ 85,2â¦ 17.5  84.4  2,65â¦ 69.1  41.1 
#> 4 Arkansas â¦ Arkaâ¦ 37,7â¦ 37,7â¦ 14.7  69.1  2,14â¦ 68.5  36.7 
#> 5 Californiâ¦ Caliâ¦ 531,â¦ 531,â¦ 15.8  70.7  2,18â¦ 48.5  28.6 
#> 6 Colorado â¦ Coloâ¦ 65,4â¦ 65,4â¦ 15.8  73.1  2,35â¦ 49.2  28.6 
#> # â¦ with 5 more variables: col_7 <chr>, col_8 <chr>,
#> #   col_9 <chr>, col_10 <chr>, year_of_data <dbl>
```

We can now grab the correct column.


```r
tfr_data <- 
  raw_dhs_data |> 
  mutate(TFR = if_else(year_of_data < 2008, col_4, col_3)) |> 
  select(state, year_of_data, TFR) |> 
  rename(year = year_of_data)
head(tfr_data)
#> # A tibble: 6 Ã 3
#>   state       year TFR    
#>   <chr>      <dbl> <chr>  
#> 1 Alabama     2000 2,021.0
#> 2 Alaska      2000 2,437.0
#> 3 Arizona     2000 2,652.5
#> 4 Arkansas    2000 2,140.0
#> 5 California  2000 2,186.0
#> 6 Colorado    2000 2,356.5
```


Finally, we need to convert the case.


```r
head(tfr_data)
#> # A tibble: 6 Ã 3
#>   state       year TFR    
#>   <chr>      <dbl> <chr>  
#> 1 Alabama     2000 2,021.0
#> 2 Alaska      2000 2,437.0
#> 3 Arizona     2000 2,652.5
#> 4 Arkansas    2000 2,140.0
#> 5 California  2000 2,186.0
#> 6 Colorado    2000 2,356.5

tfr_data <- 
  tfr_data |> 
  mutate(TFR = str_remove_all(TFR, ","),
         TFR = as.numeric(TFR))

head(tfr_data)
#> # A tibble: 6 Ã 3
#>   state       year   TFR
#>   <chr>      <dbl> <dbl>
#> 1 Alabama     2000 2021 
#> 2 Alaska      2000 2437 
#> 3 Arizona     2000 2652.
#> 4 Arkansas    2000 2140 
#> 5 California  2000 2186 
#> 6 Colorado    2000 2356.
```

And run some checks.


```r
tfr_data$state %>% unique() %>% length() == 51
#> [1] TRUE

tfr_data$year %>% unique() %>% length() == 19
#> [1] TRUE
```

In particular we want for there to be 51 states and for there to be 19 years.

And we are done (Table \@ref(tab:tfrforthewin))!


```r
tfr_data |>
  slice(1:10) |>
  knitr:: kable(
    caption = "First ten rows of a dataset of TFR by US state, 2000-2019",
    col.names = c("State", "Year", "TFR"),
    digits = 0,
    booktabs = TRUE, 
    linesep = "",
    format.args = list(big.mark = ",")
  )
```

<!-- ## Semi-structured -->

<!-- ### JSON and XML -->














<!-- @benoit2020text -->



<!-- Text data is all around us, and in many cases is some of the earliest types of data that we are exposed to. Recent increases in computational power, the development of new methods, and the enormous availability of text, means that there has been a great deal of interest in using text as data. Initial methods tend to focus, essentially, on converting text into numbers and then analyzing them using traditional methods. More recent methods have begun to take advantage of the structure that is inherent in text, to draw additional meaning. The difference is perhaps akin to a child who can group similar colors, compared with a child who knows what objects are; although both crocodiles and trees are green, and you can do something with that knowledge, you can do more by knowing that a crocodile could eat you, and a tree probably won't. -->

<!-- Here we cover a variety of techniques designed to equip you with the basics of using text as data. One of the great things about text data is that it is typically not generated for the purposes of our analysis. That is great because it removes one of the unobservable variables that we typically have to worry about. The trade-off is that we typically have to do a bunch more work to get it into a form that we can work with. -->



### Optical Character Recognition

All of the above is predicated on having a PDF that is already 'digitized'. But what if it is images? In that case we need to first use Optical Character Recognition (OCR) using `tesseract` [@citetesseract]. This is a R wrapper around the Tesseract open-source OCR engine.

Let us see an example with a scan from the first page of Jane Eyre (Figure \@ref(fig:janescan)).

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="/Users/rohanalexander/Documents/book/figures/jane_scan.png" alt="Scan of first page of Jane Eyre" width="90%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:janescan)Scan of first page of Jane Eyre</p>
</div>


```r
library(tesseract)

text <- tesseract::ocr(here::here("jane_scan.png"), engine = tesseract("eng"))
cat(text)
```







<!-- ### Preparing text datasets -->

<!-- *This section draws on Sharla Gelfand's blog post, linked in the required readings.* -->

<!-- As much as I would like to stick with Australian economics and politics examples, I realise that this is probably only of limited interest to most of you. As such, in this section we will consider a dataset of Sephora reviews. Please read Sharla's blog post (https://sharla.party/post/crying-sephora/) for another take on this dataset. -->

<!-- In this section we assume that there is some text data that you have gathered. At this point we need to change it into a form that we can work with. For some applications this will be counts of words. For others it may be some variant of this. The dataset that we are going to use is from Sephora, was scraped by [Connie](https://twitter.com/crabbage_/) and I originally became aware of it because of [Sharla](https://sharla.party/post/crying-sephora/). -->

<!-- First let's read in the data. -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- # This code is taken from https://sharla.party/post/crying-sephora/ -->
<!-- library(dplyr) -->
<!-- library(jsonlite) -->
<!-- library(tidytext) -->

<!-- crying <-  -->
<!--   jsonlite::fromJSON("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/everestpipkin/datagardens/master/students/khanniie/5_newDataSet/crying_dataset.json", -->
<!--   simplifyDataFrame = TRUE -->
<!-- ) -->

<!-- crying <- as_tibble(crying[["reviews"]]) -->

<!-- head(crying) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- names(crying) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- We'll focus on the `review_body` variable and the number of stars `stars` that the reviewer gave. Most of them are 5 stars, so we'll just focus on whether or not the review is five stars. -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- crying <-  -->
<!--   crying |>  -->
<!--   select(review_body, stars) |>  -->
<!--   mutate(stars = str_remove(stars, " stars?"),  # The question mark at the end means it'l get rid of 'star' and 'stars'. -->
<!--          stars = as.integer(stars) -->
<!--          ) |>  -->
<!--   mutate(five_stars = if_else(stars == 5, 1, 0)) -->

<!-- table(crying$stars) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- In this example we are going to split everything into separate words. When we do this it is just searching for a space, and so what other types of elements are going to be considered 'words'? -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- crying_by_words <-  -->
<!--   crying |> -->
<!--   tidytext::unnest_tokens(word, review_body, token = "words") -->

<!-- head(crying_by_words) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- We now want to count the number of times each word is used by each of the star classifications. -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- crying_by_words <-  -->
<!--   crying_by_words |>  -->
<!--   count(stars, word, sort = TRUE) -->

<!-- head(crying_by_words) -->

<!-- crying_by_words |>  -->
<!--   filter(stars == 1) |>  -->
<!--   head() -->

<!-- ``` -->

<!-- So you can see that the most popular word for five-star reviews is 'i', and that the most popular word for one star reviews is 'the'. -->

<!-- At this point, we can use the data to do a whole bunch of different things, but one nice measure to look at is term frequency e.g. in this case how many times is a word used in reviews with a particular star rating. The issue is that there are a lot of words that are commonly used regardless of context. As such, we may also like to look at the inverse document frequency in which we 'penalise' words that occur in many particular star ratings. For instance, 'the' probably occurs in both one star and five star reviews and so its idf is lower than 'hate' which probably only occurs in one star reviews. The term frequencyâinverse document frequency (tf-idf) is then the product of these. -->

<!-- We can create this value using the `bind_tf_idf()` function from the `tidytext` package, and this will create a bunch of new columns, one for each word and star combination.  -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- # This code, and the one in the next block, is from Julia Silge: https://juliasilge.com/blog/sherlock-holmes-stm/ -->
<!-- crying_by_words_tf_idf <-  -->
<!--   crying_by_words |> -->
<!--   bind_tf_idf(word, stars, n) |> -->
<!--   arrange(-tf_idf) -->

<!-- head(crying_by_words_tf_idf) -->
<!-- ``` -->


<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- # crying_by_words_tf_idf |>  -->
<!-- #   group_by(stars) |> -->
<!-- #   top_n(10) |> -->
<!-- #   ungroup |>  -->
<!-- #   mutate(word = reorder_within(word, tf_idf, stars)) |> -->
<!-- #   mutate(stars = as_factor(stars)) |> -->
<!-- #   filter(stars %in% c(1, 5)) |>  -->
<!-- #   ggplot(aes(word, tf_idf, fill = stars)) + -->
<!-- #     geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) + -->
<!-- #     facet_wrap(vars(stars), scales = "free") + -->
<!-- #     scale_x_reordered() + -->
<!-- #     coord_flip() + -->
<!-- #     labs(x = "Word",  -->
<!-- #          y = "tf-idf") + -->

### Tutorial

Please redo the web scraping example, but for one of: [Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_prime_ministers_of_Australia), [Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_prime_ministers_of_Canada), [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_prime_ministers_of_India), or [New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_prime_ministers_of_New_Zealand). 

Plan, gather, and clean the data, and then use it to create a similar table to the one created above. Write a few paragraphs about your findings. Then write a few paragraphs about the data source, what you gathered, and how you went about it. What took longer than you expected? When did it become fun? What would you do differently next time you do this? Your submission should be at least two pages and likely more.

Please submit a link to a PDF produced using R Markdown that includes a link to the GitHub repo.
